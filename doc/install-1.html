<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>The APC Action Applications provide easy automated publishing for
non-profit WWW sites and 'Usenet-like' sharing of articles between sites.
<P>Action Applications consist of
<UL>
<LI>actual www pages which display the content. These pages can be
designed individually. At one spot, they contain an "include" directive
which is automatically replaced by the current content whenever a user
requests this page, and</LI>
<LI>a database engine including a permission system, a storage and a content
managing system. This system has a www interface and administrators,
editors and authors of a certain page can do their work completely using
that interface.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="slices"></A> <A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Slices</A>
</H2>

<P>Action Applications provide something called <EM>slices</EM> which represent
one <EM>application</EM> each. Each application/slice has its own content,
its own configuration, permissions, and so on. If you run the Action
Applications on a server, you can set up such slices for your users and
grant individual <EM>slice administration rights</EM>. Users are then
administering their respective slices in every way.
<P>Slices are of a certain <EM>type</EM>. There are currently seven slice types
implemented within the Action Applications:
<UL>
<LI>News</LI>
<LI>Action Alerts</LI>
<LI>Event Listings</LI>
<LI>Press Release Publisher</LI>
<LI>Job Listing</LI>
<LI>Address List and</LI>
<LI>Media Monitoring.</LI>
</UL>

Slice types differ in information field names, number of fields and
default presentation. Still, all the slice types work basically in the 
same way. It is possible to add your own slice type if those do not
suit your needs.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Users, Roles and Permissions</A>
</H2>

<P>Action Applications provides its own user management engine. Authentication
and authorization are implemented by a permission system which supports
two different back ends: LDAP and SQL. You are free to choose which back end
you want to use. In either case, it is possible to create groups of users
and groups of groups. Privileges which are granted to the group will 
be promoted to all its members.
<P>There are five roles:
<DL>
<DT><B>Reader.</B><DD><P>Readers do not need to have user accounts in the Action Applications permission
system. Most of the times, they actually do not realize that they
have to do with something like the Action Applications. They just
view regular WWW pages and can read the information provided by
the Action Application slice owners.
<DT><B>Author.</B><DD><P>Authors must have user accounts in the Action Applications permission system.
The role "author" is bound to a certain slice. Any Action Applications user who
has "author" privileges for an Action Applications slice can submit new information
items for this slice and remove and edit her own submissions.
<DT><B>Editor.</B><DD><P>Editors must have user accounts in the Action Applications permission system.
The role "editor" is bound to a certain slice. An Action Applications user who
has "editor" privileges for an Action Applications slice can do everything an
author for this slice can. Additionally, she can pick items 
from other slices, and edit, approve or expire every
item her slice, which includes other authors' items, as well. 
An editor has full control over
items which were published in her slice, but cannot modify the full 
text of items imported from other slices (the so called ?fed items?).
<DT><B>Administrator.</B><DD><P>Administrators must have user accounts in the Action Applications 
permission system. The role "administrator" is bound to a certain slice.
An Action Applications user who has "administrator" privileges for an Action Applications slice can do 
everything an editor for this slice can. Additionally, 
she can set or change the
configuration of her slice. The administrator can design the layout of the web site, define which
categories are used in the slice and from and to which other slices items are shared. She also
sets which parameters are predefined and which can be modified by the authors/editors of the
slice.
<DT><B>Super Administrator.</B><DD><P>Super administrators must have user accounts in
the Action Applications permission system. The role "super administrator" is <EM>not</EM>
bound to a slice. Super administrators (superadmins) can do
everything. This means, they can do anything a slice administrator
can, but for <EM>every</EM> slice; additionally, they can add slices
to the system.
</DL>
<P>Permission management can generally be done by everyone for roles
below their own level.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Action Applications Software Components</A>
</H2>

<P>Action Applications consist of several software components. Only
one of them is provided by the APC Action Applications package:
<UL>
<LI>The APC Action Application software. These are basically a set of 
PHP scripts running within a web server.</LI>
<LI>A database server.
The database server
does not have to be on the same host as the other components. It can
be used for other applications as well.</LI>
<LI>Optionally a LDAP server. LDAP provides access control to the Action Applications. 
It is possible
to use a different permission system, such as a SQL database based one. LDAP
has the advantage of being a universal directory service whose information
can be used by other applications, such as address books or email delivery
services, too.</LI>
<LI>A WWW Server. The WWW Server provides the access from
the network via the http protocol. It runs the Action Applications programs
whenever someone accesses the Action Application controlled pages.</LI>
<LI>PHP3. The PHP interpreter is needed to execute the Action Applications PHP scripts.</LI>
</UL>

See section 
<A HREF="install-2.html#requirements">Requirements / Preconditions / Suggested Environment</A> 
for details about the installation of all the components.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Conventions used in this document</A>
</H2>

<P>Command line input is shown including the command line prompt so it is
clear which lines should be typed in. The prompt
indicates if a command should be run as a normal user or as root: For 
normal users, the prompt is <CODE>%</CODE>, and for root, the prompt is <CODE>#</CODE>.
<P>An example is shown below:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
