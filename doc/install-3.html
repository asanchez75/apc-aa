<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Platform</A>
</H2>

<P>The installation instructions given here are intended for use with RedHat
Linux. We used version 6.0 and 6.2. This specifically means that the <EM>rpm</EM> 
tool is
used wherever possible. 
<P><EM>If your system does not support the rpm tool</EM>,
most procedures will be quite different from what is shown here. 
You will probably have to do most installations by building the software
itself. It is beyond the scope of this document to describe that although
necessary configurations options will be mentioned.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 MySQL database back end</A>
</H2>

<P>Check if you have already MySQL 3.22.32 or newer installed:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
% rpm -q MySQL
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If it is not installed or if the version used is too old, install
it.
If you don't have a CD with MySQL RPM files, download it from 
<A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql.html</A>. (MySQL is
<EM>not</EM> included in RedHat Linux.) Use the stable
release version. Get files from the "standard binary RPMs" part: 
"<EM>Server for ... systems</EM>", "<EM>Client programs for ... systems</EM>"
and "<EM>Include files and libraries for development for ... systems</EM>".
(The latter is needed re recompile php if this has to be done, see 
below.)
<P>As root, install the RPMs:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
# rpm -Uv MySQL-3.22.32-1.i386.rpm
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This command will install the MySQL database server, create some administrative
tables and already start the server itself. It also creates a file in
<CODE>/etc/rc.d/init.d/</CODE> and symbolic links in <CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc?.d/</CODE>
so the server is started and stopped properly on system start and shutdown.
<P>Also install the MySQL client tools and the development files:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
# rpm -Uv MySQL-client-3.22.32-1.i386.rpm
# rpm -Uv MySQL-devel-3.22.32-1.i386.rpm 
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Since the server is now running, it can be accessed. It is a good idea to
immediately set a password for the MySQL root user.
Remind the password - better not use <EM>mysqlpass</EM> for obvious reasons.
We will refer to this password as the <EM>mysql root password</EM>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
# mysqladmin -u root password 'mysqlpass'
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Then create your initial Action Applications database. To do this, you need the file
<CODE>aadb.sql</CODE> from the Action Applications doc directory. It contains SQL commands
which create the database. When queried for a password, use the
mysql root password.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
# mysql -u root -p
Enter password: 
mysql> CREATE DATABASE aadb;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)

mysql> QUIT
Bye
# mysql -u root -p aadb &lt; doc/aadb.sql
Enter Password:
#
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Create a user in MySQL that will be able to access the new aadb database. 
Again, you will need to provide a new password; below, it is <EM>password2</EM>.
Use a different one and remind it. We will refer to this password as the
<EM>aadbuser password</EM>.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
# mysql -u root -p

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 OpenLDAP</A>
</H2>

<H3>Package Installation</H3>

<P>Note: You only need the OpenLDAP server if you decided to use LDAP as
the permission system. The OpenLDAP server does not need to be on the same
host as the Action Applications themselves are.
<P>Check if you have already the OpenLDAP server installed:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
% man slapd
No manual entry for slapd
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If the manual page appears, it is very likely you have the OpenLDAP server on
the machine. (This check is preferred over the rpm way because the OpenLDAP
rpm exists only for a short time so far and many machines probably have it
installed without the rpm.)
<P>OpenLDAP is included in RedHat Linux 6.1; releases prior to 6.1 don't have
it. It is possible to install the rpms on any 6.x RedHat Linux though.
<P>If you don't have the OpenLDAP server installed, and if you don't have
the rpm's, get the rpm's from a 
RedHat mirror site, for example from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/linux/redhat-updates/6.2/i386/openldap-1.2.9-6.i386.rpm">ftp://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/linux/redhat-updates/6.2/i386/openldap-1.2.9-6.i386.rpm</A>

</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Setup: Configuration</H3>

<P>If you didn't have an OpenLDAP server running, you will need to create the
<CODE>/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</CODE> file - this is the server configuration file.
Use the file <CODE>doc/slapd.conf</CODE> from the Action Applications distribution to create it.
This file is well documented and contains hints about which spots need
to be modified. <EM>The LDAP server will not work properly if you don't edit
this file.</EM> You will need some basic data to fill in here; see at
<A HREF="install-2.html#ldap_thoughts">LDAP basic info</A> for details.
<P>The root dn password in this file can be trivial for now (leave it as it is,
"password"), we will replace it
shortly with a secure one. We refer to this password as the 
<EM>ldap root dn</EM> password.
<P>Also you need to copy some other files from the Action Applications doc directory to the 
<CODE>/etc/openldap/</CODE> directory and change the file mode of the main
configuration file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
# chmod 600 /etc/openldap/slapd.conf 
# cp slapd.oc.netscape.conf slapd.at.netscape.conf slapd.oc.apc.conf slapd.at.apc.conf /etc/openldap/
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Edit the file <CODE>/etc/openldap/ldap.conf</CODE>. After installation, it
only contains comments. Put in two lines containing your base dn and
the host where the ldap server runs:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
BASE    ou=AA
HOST    localhost
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

(This file is used by the programs that <EM>access</EM> a ldap server, not
by the server itself. It only affects accessing programs on the machine
where the programs run.)
<P>Create the directory where the LDAP database will live
(again, replace the domain name with the one your base dn was
derived from):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<P>
<H3>Initial database creation</H3>

<P>The OpenLDAP server needs an initial database before its first start. To
create this database, you need a <EM>ldif</EM> format file which can be translated
into the database by the ldapmodify command. There is an example ldif file,
namely <CODE>LDIF.ini</CODE>, in the doc/ directory. Edit this file to suit your
needs according to the following instructions.
<P>The initial ldif file should contain four objects:
<UL>
<LI>Action Applications base object</LI>
<LI>The Action Applications account object (used by Action Applications to access the ldap server)</LI>
<LI>ldap tree for AA's users</LI>
<LI>ldap tree for ACLs used by the Action Applications</LI>
</UL>

Objects are separated by blank lines. Each line consists of a keyword,
followed by a colon, followed by a value. The first line of each object
is the dn, thus the keyword is "dn". The other object lines are its
attributes.
<P>You can edit this file, but it's not necessary.
<P>We can tell the ldap server to create the objects:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
% ldapmodify -a -f ldiffile -D "cn=root,ou=AA" -w password
adding new entry ou=AA

adding new entry cn=aalduser,ou=AA
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>If the server responds with an error message:
<DL>
<DT><B>ldap_add: Insufficient access</B><DD><P>Check the rootdn: entry in
the slapd.conf file and what you typed after the -D switch
to ldapmodify. They must match.
<DT><B>ldap_add: Object class violation</B><DD><P>The objects in the ldif
file are not consistent. Check if you accidently deleted lines
from the file.
</DL>
<P>In order to check the server, search all the objects you just added. The 
result should be similar to the ldif file you just used.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
% ldapsearch -L objectclass=\*
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If you get an error message or nothing, check the 
<CODE>/etc/openldap/ldap.conf</CODE> file for the BASE and HOST entries.
<P>
<H3>LDAP passwords</H3>

<P>There are two passwords we must maintain for the ldap
server. We refer to them as the <EM>root dn password</EM>, which is used
to access the LDAP root account and the 
<EM>aalduser account password</EM>, which the Action Applications use to 
access the aalduser account and the LDAP server.
<P>We should now set the root dn password in 
<CODE>/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</CODE>. To do this, first set the aalduser account
password using ldappasswd, then make a query to the ldap server so we get an 
encrypted version of the password back, and 
copy and paste the encrypted password into the sldap.conf file.
When you issue the following commands, the password given after the -w 
switches must match the <EM>old</EM> root dn password which is still defined
in clear text in <CODE>/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</CODE>. When prompted for the
new password, enter the new root dn password you want to set. And remind it!
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
% ldappasswd -D "cn=root,ou=AA" -w password -t "cn=aalduser,ou=AA" -H ssha
New password: 
Re-enter new password: 
% ldapsearch -D "cn=root,ou=AA" -w password -L cn=aa
dn: cn=aalduser,ou=AA
objectclass: top

cn: aa
sn: Toolkit
description: Account used by AA to access LDAP DB
userpassword: {ssha}1KoDEQd/MrY+JPnFgotki5AZrCyfGZYr
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If everything worked right, you get the line "userpassword" as shown.
This is the encrypted version of the new root dn password you entered.
Paste this string (including the "{ssha}") into the rootpw: line in
<CODE>/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</CODE>. 
After the next server restart, the old root dn password "password" 
will no longer work, instead, you use the password you just entered.
<P>Try to access the ldap server using the aalduser account:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
% ldapsearch -D "cn=aalduser,ou=AA" -W -L objectclass=\*
Enter LDAP Password: 
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You should get all the objects that are stored. In case of an error message,
check the spelling of the command line... errors most likely have to do with
spelling errors.
<P><B>Now</B> you can change the password for the aalduser account 
again so it is different from the root dn password:

<H2><A NAME="php_install"></A> <A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 PHP3</A>
</H2>

<H3>PHP3 installation</H3>

<P>Hint: The use of PHP4 has not yet been tested.
<P>php3 runs within the apache web server as a module. We need a version of
php3 which includes support for <EM>two optional php modules</EM>, namely ldap
and mysql. These modules provide access to ldap and mysql databases,
respectively, from php3 programs. 
(If you don't use ldap with the Action Applications, you will not need the
ldap php support.)
<P>There are many ways to install all this, and many can generate a lot of
trouble. The cleanest and easiest way is, again, to use RPMs.
<P>
<H3>Testing php3 installation</H3>

<P>First, create a test WWW page to find out the status of php3 support on
your system. This can be done easily by executing this command (assuming
<CODE>/home/httpd/heml</CODE> is your DocumentRoot directory:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
echo "&lt;?php phpinfo() ?>" > /home/httpd/html/test.php3
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Access the page with a web browser (http://localhost/test.php3). 
<UL>
<LI>If you see the string <CODE>php phpinfo() ?</CODE>, you do not have
php3 installed or at least it is not enabled.</LI>
<LI>If you see a page beginning with <CODE>PHP Version</CODE>, you have a working
php. Browse through the <CODE>Extensions</CODE> section. Look for an extension
named <CODE>MySQL</CODE> and, if you are using the LDAP permission system, for one
named <CODE>LDAP</CODE>. If both are there, you are lucky because the php setup
id complete; otherwise, you must install the missing parts.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Installing PHP</H3>

<P>Unfortunately, as of this writing, there is no mysql support for php which
comes as an rpm made by RedHat. There are some mysql modules for php on
the RedHat server, but they are all for older versions of php.
<P>RedHat 6.1 and 6.2 above have a php rpm which is prepared for inclusion of 
other php
modules. The ldap module is provided. The mysql module is not provided,
but it is possible to build the mysql module. The advantage of going this
way is that you will have the RPMs which are easy to install on all your
machines and that the RPM install scripts will manage necessary configuration
file changes by themselves.  The disadvantage is that the RPM build process
requires some more packages installed. This is described in the
next section.
<P>If you don't want to use RPMs, you must build PHP the traditional
way. This is described in the sections following the next section.
<P>
<H3>Building the PHP RPMs including mysql</H3>

<P>
<OL>
<LI> To build the PHP RPMs including the mysql support, 
you need the following
packages installed which you find at www.redhat.com:
<UL>
<LI>apache-devel</LI>
<LI>imap-devel</LI>
<LI>openldap-devel</LI>
<LI>postgresql-devel</LI>
<LI>MySQL-devel</LI>
<LI>apache-devel (version 1.3.9 or newer)</LI>
<LI>and there must be a general development environment.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI> In order to build RPMs, you need an RPM build environment.
For a quick setup of this, use the following commands:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>

In this example, the php source rpm version 3.0.15-2 was used.
</LI>
<LI>Edit the file <CODE>~/rpmbuild/SPECS/php.spec</CODE>. This file is
the description used by rpm to build the php packages, and the mysql
section is commented out (this is the reason for the fact that there is
no mysql module for php on the RedHat server). You need to uncomment all
lines which concern mysql, and you need to add a section describing the
mysql package. There is a patch which does the right thing for the
version 3.0.15-2; the patch can be found in the Action Applications doc directory as
<CODE>php-spec.patch</CODE>. To apply this patch, copy it to the
<CODE>~/rpmbuild/SPECS</CODE> directory and use this command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
% cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS; patch &lt; php-spec.patch

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
