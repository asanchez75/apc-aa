<h2>How to put an item on the development priorities list</h2>

The list below contains
all the requests posted to the apc-aa-general@lists.sourceforge.net
mailinglist, that have the word 'feature request' in the subject.

<p> The list below is prioritized by Honza Malik, the primary developer of
the software.  Honza's organization, <a
href=http://www.ecn.cz/>ECONNECT</a>, is actively developing the
software to meet the needs of its users.

<p>If there is a feature on this list that you need done right away,
you could either program it yourself (the software is open-source) or
pay someone to develop it.  Several projects realized that the
ActionApps meet 90% of their needs, and they can get a full-featured
solution by paying for or writing the 10% of the code they need and
contributing it back to the ActionApps development tree. <p>

<p> If you want a new feature, but cannot pay for it or program it yourself,
mention your request on the apc-aa-general mailinglist, and say what you
want, why it is a good idea, and as much details as you can about how 
it could work.  The apps communinity values your good ideas about making the
software better, and your idea will be put on this list.
