<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Hardware Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>The Action Applications can run on every computer which runs one of the supported operating
systems. 
<P>There is probably a minimum requirement in terms of processor
speed and amount of memory. If the Action Applications run on a single computer (including
the MySQL database back end), it should be no less than a 200 MHz 
processor and 64 MByte of RAM.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Software Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>Note: There are instructions for the installation of all software modules
but the operating system in the next chapter: 
<A HREF="install-3.html#install_other">Installation of other packages needed by the Action Applications</A><H3>Operating System</H3>

<P>The primary supported operating system is GNU/Linux. However, the Action Applications should
run on any unix or unix-like operating system which can run all the other
software components. The Action Applications were developed
and tested on <B>Red Hat Linux</B> 
6.0 and 6.2, so it is recommended to use this OS.
This installation guide has a strong focus on Red Hat Linux.
<P>It is known that Action Applications also run on FreeBSD 2.2.7.
<P>
<H3>Database Server</H3>

<P>An SQL database server 
is needed by the Action Applications in order to store all the information. 
The only supported SQL server so far is the <B>MySQL</B> database server. The data
is organized in several tables in the database. Action Applications need one logical database
within the database server. The server can be used for other applications
as well.
<P>The database server does not need to be on the same machine as the other
components are.
<P>Action Applications need at least MySQL version 3.22.32. Older version may work but have not
been tested, and they contain known security holes.
<P>If you want to use a different database server than MySQL,
for example, if you have 
already a database server running, you will have to do some porting work.
Action Applications were written with database back end portability in mind, and as little
as possible MySQL specific functions were used. It is important that there
is PHP support for the database server you want to use.
<P>
<H3>Permission System</H3>

<P>If you want to use LDAP as the permission system,
you should use the <B>OpenLDAP</B> server software. Other LDAP servers should
work, too, but the Action Applications have been tested with OpenLDAP only.
<P>If you have already an OpenLDAP server running, you may skip the rest of
this section.
<P>
<A NAME="ldap_thoughts"></A> 
Using LDAP, some thoughts about the LDAP database organization should be
wasted. An LDAP database is an hierarchically 
structured system of objects, each member of one or more certain classes.
Every object in your database has its place in the potentially
global LDAP hierarchy. Each object has a unique name, the so called
<EM>distinguished name</EM>, or short <EM>dn</EM>. The dn consists of the full "path"
from the global LDAP name space to the object, similar to names in the
domain name system.
<P>In order to set up the LDAP server for Action Applications, you need to figure out some
information you want to use:
<UL>
<LI>Your base dn. This is the common part all your LDAP objects will have
in their dn, describing the "path" from the global LDAP name space to your
organization. It is recommended that you use a domain name you own for 
that. (You could also use a geographical category, but this is not 
described here.) A domain name can be described in a LDAP dn using the
<EM>dc</EM> attribute. For example, the base dn for a possible domain name
<EM>ecn.apc.org</EM> would be <CODE>dc=ecn,dc=apc,dc=org</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>Your LDAP administrative account. OpenLDAP's built-in access
control needs a <EM>root</EM> object which has all privileges. Once it exists,
the root object can be used to modify the data stored in the LDAP database.
Like every object in the database, the root object needs a dn. It is 
recommended that you use the canonical name <EM>root</EM>. Following the
example above, this gives us a root object dn of 
<CODE>cn=root,dc=ecn,dc=apc,dc=org</CODE>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Note: As with the database server,
the OpenLDAP server does not necessarily need to be running on the same
machine as the Action Applications.
<P>If you are <EM>not</EM> using LDAP as the permission system basis, permission
information will be stored within the SQL database.
<P>
<H3>WWW (http) Server</H3>

<P>The Action Applications have been developed and tested with the 
<B>apache</B> http server. Other http servers might work, too, but there are some
things to consider:
<UL>
<LI>The Action Application relay on a feature in the apache http server
which allows to pass GET parameters (query strings) to scripts which are
run from a SSI (server side include) command in a page.
It is known that the
Microsoft Internet Information Server, for example, does not do that.</LI>
<LI>The apache http server can be configured to load PHP as a 
<EM>module</EM>. This speeds things up a lot because the PHP interpreter does
not have to be loaded every time a PHP script runs. Action Applications
work in CGI mode as well, though. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>PHP</H3>

<P>Action Applications are written in PHP3. The minimum version to use
should be PHP 3.0.7 but this has not been tested; we know they work with
PHP 3.0.12 and newer up to 3.0.16. PHP4 has not been tested, either.
<P>PHP can be build as a <EM>module for the apache http server</EM> or as a
<EM>standalone program</EM>. The first way is preferred for performance
reasons.
<P>Your PHP needs optional modules: 
<UL>
<LI>A module is needed to access your SQL database. For example,
if you are using 
MySQL as the database, you need the MySQL module for PHP.</LI>
<LI>If you are using LDAP as the permission system, you need the
LDAP module for PHP.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The modules can be 
<UL>
<LI><EM>compiled into PHP</EM> or</LI>
<LI><EM>loaded at run time</EM>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Both ways are described in the 
<A HREF="install-3.html#php_install">PHP installation section</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Know-How Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>To install the Action Applications, you will need some basic unix skills. You should have
installed programs before and be familiar with administration of your
system.
<P>
<H3>Other Preconditions</H3>
