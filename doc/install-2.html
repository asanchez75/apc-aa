<H2><A name=requirements></A><A name=s2>2. Requirements / Preconditions / 
Suggested Environment</A></H2>
<H2><A name=ss2.1>2.1 Hardware Requirements</A> </H2>
<P>The Action Applications can run on every computer which runs one of the 
supported operating systems. 
<P>There is probably a minimum requirement in terms of processor speed and 
amount of memory. If the Action Applications run on a single computer (including 
the MySQL database back end), it should be no less than a 200 MHz processor and 
64 MByte of RAM. 
<P>
<H2><A name=ss2.2>2.2 Software Requirements</A> </H2>
<P>Note: There are instructions for the installation of all software modules but 
  the operating system in the next chapter: <A 
href="install-3.html#install_other">Installation 
  of other packages needed by the Action Applications</A> which also contains 
  instructions on how to check the version numbers of installed packages.
<H3> Operating System</H3>
<P>The primary supported operating system is GNU/Linux. However, the Action 
Applications should run on any unix or unix-like operating system which can run 
all the other software components. The Action Applications were developed and 
tested on <B>Red Hat Linux</B> 6.0 and 6.2, so it is recommended to use this OS. 
This installation guide has a strong focus on Red Hat Linux. 
<P>It is known that Action Applications also run on FreeBSD 2.2.7. 
<P>
<H3>Database Server</H3>
<P>An SQL database server is needed by the Action Applications in order to store 
all the information. The only supported SQL server so far is the <B>MySQL</B> 
database server. The data is organized in several tables in the database. Action 
Applications need one logical database within the database server. The server 
can be used for other applications as well. 
<P>The database server does not need to be on the same machine as the other 
components are. 
<P>Action Applications need at least MySQL version 3.22.32. Older version may 
work but have not been tested, and they contain known security holes. 
<P>If you want to use a different database server than MySQL, for example, if 
you have already a database server running, you will have to do some porting 
work. Action Applications were written with database back end portability in 
mind, and as little as possible MySQL specific functions were used. It is 
important that there is PHP support for the database server you want to use. 
<P>
<H3>Permission System</H3>
<P>
Most people will use their Database Server as their permission system -- storing passwords and permissions
in mysql.

<P>If you want to use LDAP as the permission system, you should 
refer to <a href="ldap.html">apc-aa ldap page</a>

<P>
<H3>WWW (http) Server</H3>
<P>The Action Applications have been developed and tested with the <B>apache</B> 
http server. Other http servers might work, too, but there are some things to 
consider: 
<UL>
  <LI>The Action Application relay on a feature in the apache http server which 
    allows to pass GET parameters (query strings) to scripts which are run from 
    a SSI (server side include) command in a page. It is known that the Microsoft 
    Internet Information Server, for example, does not do that. 
  <LI>The apache http server can be configured to load PHP as a <EM>module</EM>. 
    This speeds things up a lot because the PHP interpreter does not have to be 
    loaded every time a PHP script runs. Action Applications work in CGI mode 
    as well, though. </LI>
  <LI>Apache needs the apache-devel module as well.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H3>PHP</H3>
<P>Action Applications are written in PHP. The minimum version to use should be 
PHP 3.0.7 but this has not been tested; we know they work with PHP 3.0.12 and 
newer up to 3.0.16. PHP4 also works.<BR>

TODO: say which versions of PHP4 work fine, and which do not.

<P>PHP can be build as a <EM>module for the apache http server</EM> or as a 
<EM>standalone program</EM>. The first way is preferred for performance reasons. 

<P>Your PHP needs optional modules: 
<UL>
  <LI>A module is needed to access your SQL database. For example, if you are 
  using MySQL as the database, you need the MySQL module for PHP. 
  <LI>it is recommended to install the GD module to support image manipulation</LI>
  <LI>If you are using LDAP as the permission system, you need the LDAP module 
  for PHP. </LI></UL>
<P>The modules can be 
<UL>
  <LI><EM>compiled into PHP</EM> or 
  <LI><EM>loaded at run time</EM>. </LI></UL>
<P>Both ways are described in the <A 
href="install-3.html#php_install">PHP installation 
  section</A>.
<P>&nbsp;
<H2><A name=ss2.3>2.3 Know-How Requirements</A> </H2>
<P>To install the Action Applications, you will need some basic unix skills. You
should have installed programs before and be familiar with administration of
your system.
