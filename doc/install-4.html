<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Installation</A>
</H2>

<P>Create a directory <CODE>aa</CODE> in your 
httpdocs directory and copy most files from the Action Applications distribution there:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
# mkdir /home/httpd/html/aa
# cd apc-aa-1.1.0
# cp -R *.css *.php3 admin images include /home/httpd/html/aa
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Edit <CODE>/home/httpd/html/aa/include/config.php3</CODE>. 
This is the main Action Applications configuration
file. It contains comments which explain everything there.
Note that this file may not contain anything before the <CODE>&lt;?php</CODE> line
at the top and after the <CODE>?&gt;</CODE> line at the bottom.
<P><B>The file <CODE>/home/httpd/html/aa/include/config.php3</CODE> now contains
passwords. It should therefore not be world readable. On the other hand,
the http server must be able to read it. Read the chapter on
<A HREF="install-6.html#security">security</A>
 for a possible solution for this problem.</B>
<P>Point your Web browser to 
<A HREF="http://localhost/aa/admin/setup.php3">http://localhost/aa/admin/setup.php3</A>. This page helps you to create your initial superadmin account.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Creating a superadmin account</A>
</H2>

<P>Action Applications users who have the superadmin privilege may create new
slices in addition to the rights any slice administrator has.
<P>Creating a superadmin account will be necessary whenever you don't have
one left.
This is the case at installation time and in case you have accidently deleted
the last superadmin account or accidently revoked the superadmin 
privilege from the last superadmin account.
To create a superadmin account, click on Init and fill in the form
Superadmin account. Fields marked with an asterisk are required. Click on the 
Create button.
<P>Now you should see a page with a congratulation and a link <EM>Add Slice</EM>. Follow this link. You will be asked for login name and password - log in with your
(new) superadmin account and read on in the next section to see how to
create a slice.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Your first test slice</A>
</H2>

<H3>Creating the first test slice</H3>

<P>After a successful login on 
<A HREF="http://localhost/aa/admin/sliceadd.php3">http://localhost/aa/admin/sliceadd.php3</A>,
you should see the <EM>Slice Administration - Add Slice</EM> page. Choose the
slice type (see 
<A HREF="install-1.html#slices">slices</A>
 for details) and say <EM>Add</EM>.
<P>Fill in the form. The fields shown here depend on the slice type, but some
fields are there for every slice type. Especially fill in the following 
fields:
<UL>
<LI>Headline - a title for the slice</LI>
<LI>Short name - a short description of the slices contents</LI>
<LI>Slice URL - the URL of a WWW page where you want to display the
actual content; this is the place readers will access. The page
does not need to exist at this time and it does not need to be
within the action application directory tree</LI>
<LI>Listing length - say 10</LI>
<LI>Fulltext info abstract grab length - say 200.</LI>
</UL>

You may fill in the other fields, too.
After
selecting 
<EM>insert</EM> at the page bottom the slice will be created.
<P>Each slice can have a set of categories. New information items can belong
to one or more categories. Create your first category by selecting 
<EM>New</EM>. Enter the category name and hit OK. 
<P>At this point in time, you have created a new slice and thus, a new
action application. 
<P>
<H3>Adding the first information item to the test slice</H3>

<P>Select <EM>Add Article</EM>. Fill in some information. Make sure to set the
Expire date to a day in the future and hit <EM>insert</EM>.
<P>The page you see after that tells you the HTML code which you must place
into the page which is meant to display the content (the slice URL).
<P>You might have got an idea how everything works now?
