<H2>Intro on using LDAP with ActionApplications</H2>


<B>OpenLDAP</B> server software. Other LDAP servers should work, too, but the
ActionApps have been tested with OpenLDAP only.
<P>If you have already an OpenLDAP server running, you may skip the rest of this
section.
<P><A name=ldap_thoughts></A>Using LDAP, some thoughts about the LDAP database
organization should be wasted. An LDAP database is an hierarchically structured
system of objects, each member of one or more certain classes. Every object in
your database has its place in the potentially global LDAP hierarchy. Each
object has a unique name, the so called <EM>distinguished name</EM>, or short
<EM>dn</EM>. The dn consists of the full "path" from the global LDAP name space
to the object, similar to names in the domain name system.
<P>In order to set up the LDAP server for ActionApps, you need to
figure out some information you want to use:
<UL>
  <LI>Your base dn. This is the common part all your LDAP objects will have in
  their dn, describing the "path" from the global LDAP name space to your
  organization. It is recommended that you use a domain name you own for that.
  (You could also use a geographical category, but this is not described here.)
  A domain name can be described in a LDAP dn using the <EM>dc</EM> attribute.
  For example, the base dn for a possible domain name <EM>ecn.apc.org</EM> would
  be <CODE>dc=ecn,dc=apc,dc=org</CODE>.
  <LI>Your LDAP administrative account. OpenLDAP's built-in access control needs
  a <EM>root</EM> object which has all privileges. Once it exists, the root
  object can be used to modify the data stored in the LDAP database. Like every
  object in the database, the root object needs a dn. It is recommended that you
  use the canonical name <EM>root</EM>. Following the example above, this gives
  us a root object dn of <CODE>cn=root,dc=ecn,dc=apc,dc=org</CODE>. </LI></UL>
<P>Note: As with the database server, the OpenLDAP server does not necessarily
need to be running on the same machine as the ActionApps.


<H2>Step by Step instruction for Installing OpenLDAP</H2>
The OpenLDAP server does not need to be on the same host as
the ActionApps themselves are.
<P>Check if you have already the OpenLDAP server installed:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE>% man slapd
No manual entry for slapd
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>If the manual page appears, it is very likely you have the
OpenLDAP server on the machine. (This check is preferred over the rpm way
because the OpenLDAP rpm exists only for a short time so far and many machines
probably have it installed without the rpm.)
<P>OpenLDAP is included in RedHat Linux 6.1; releases prior to 6.1 don't have
it. It is possible to install the rpms on any 6.x RedHat Linux though.
<P>If you don't have the OpenLDAP server installed, and if you don't have the
rpm's, get the rpm's from a RedHat mirror site, for example from <A
href="ftp://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/linux/redhat-updates/6.2/i386/openldap-1.2.9-6.i386.rpm">ftp://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/linux/redhat-updates/6.2/i386/openldap-1.2.9-6.i386.rpm</A>
and <A
href="ftp://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/linux/redhat-updates/6.2/i386/openldap-devel-1.2.9-6.i386.rpm">ftp://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/linux/redhat-updates/6.2/i386/openldap-devel-1.2.9-6.i386.rpm</A>
and install them:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE># rpm -Uv openldap-1.2.9-6.i386.rpm
openldap-1.2.9-6
# rpm -Uv openldap-devel-1.2.9-6.i386.rpm
openldap-devel-1.2.9-6
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Setup: Configuration</H3>
<P>If you didn't have an OpenLDAP server running, you will need to create the
<CODE>/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</CODE> file - this is the server configuration
file. Use the file <CODE>doc/slapd.conf</CODE> from the ActionApps
distribution to create it. This file is well documented and contains hints about
which spots need to be modified. <EM>The LDAP server will not work properly if
you don't edit this file.</EM> You will need some basic data to fill in here;
see at <A href="install-2.html#ldap_thoughts">LDAP
basic info</A> for details.
<P>The root dn password in this file can be trivial for now (leave it as it is,
"password"), we will replace it shortly with a secure one. We refer to this
password as the <EM>ldap root dn</EM> password.
<P>Also you need to copy some other files from the ActionApps doc
directory to the <CODE>/etc/openldap/</CODE> directory and change the file mode
of the main configuration file:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE># chmod 600 /etc/openldap/slapd.conf
# cp slapd.oc.netscape.conf slapd.at.netscape.conf slapd.oc.apc.conf slapd.at.apc.conf /etc/openldap/
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Edit the file <CODE>/etc/openldap/ldap.conf</CODE>. After installation, it
only contains comments. Put in two lines containing your base dn and the host
where the ldap server runs:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE>BASE    dc=ecn,dc=apc,dc=org
HOST    localhost
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>(This file is used by the programs that <EM>access</EM> a
ldap server, not by the server itself. It only affects accessing programs on the
machine where the programs run.)
<P>Create the directory where the LDAP database will live (again, replace the
domain name with the one your base dn was derived from):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE># mkdir /var/lib/ldap/ecn.apc.org
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<H3>Start the ldap server</H3>
<P>Try to start the ldap server and check messages from the messages logfile
(normally <CODE>/var/log/messages</CODE>):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE># /etc/rc.d/init.d/ldap start
Starting ldap:                                             [  OK  ]
# tail /var/log/messages
[...]
Jul 17 11:01:28 ecn ldap: slapd startup succeeded
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Make the ldap server start on system boots:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE># chkconfig ldap on
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Initial database creation</H3>
<P>The OpenLDAP server needs an initial database before its first start. To
create this database, you need a <EM>ldif</EM> format file which can be
translated into the database by the ldapmodify command. There is an example ldif
file, namely <CODE>LDIF.ini</CODE>, in the doc/ directory. Edit this file to
suit your needs according to the following instructions.
<P>The initial ldif file should contain five objects:
<UL>
  <LI>Your base object
  <LI>The ActionApps account object (used by ActionApps to
  access the ldap server)
  <LI>A group object for ActionApps administrators (superadmins)
  <LI>One initial superadmin account object which is the initial member of the
  group of superadmins
  <LI>The ActionApps APCACL object (ActionApps access control
  storage object) of ActionApps administrators </LI></UL>Objects are
separated by blank lines. Each line consists of a keyword, followed by a colon,
followed by a value. The first line of each object is the dn, thus the keyword
is "dn". The other object lines are its attributes.
<P>Edit these spots:
<UL>
  <LI>Everywhere: replace all occurances of the example "dc=ecn,dc=apc,dc=org"
  base dn with your own one (hopefully your editor has a good search and replace
  function).
  <LI>root object (first block)
  <DL>
    <DT><B>o: Econnect</B>
    <DD>
    <P>Replace "Econnect" with your organization name. </P>
    <DT><B>dc: ecn</B>
    <DD>
    <P>Replace "ecn" with your base dn domain name, but only the first word up
    to but not including the first dot. </P>
    <DT><B>description</B>
    <DD>
    <P>Fill in a descriptive text describing your organization. </P></DD></DL>
  <LI>ActionApps account object (second block)
  <P>No modifications </P>
  <LI>ActionApps administrator (superadmin) group object (third block)
  <DL>
    <DT><B>member</B>
    <DD>
    <P>Fill in the dn of the personal initial member object (see below)
  </P></DD></DL>
  <LI>Initial superadmin account object (forth block)
  <DL>
    <DT><B>dn</B>
    <DD>
    <P>Replace "uid=karel" with "uid=XXX" where XXX is a user id for the initial
    administrator group member (for example, use qour first name). </P>
    <DT><B>cn</B>
    <DD>
    <P>Fill in the canonical name of the initial member. </P>
    <DT><B>sn</B>
    <DD>
    <P>Fill in the surname of the initial member. </P>
    <DT><B>uid</B>
    <DD>
    <P>Repeat the user id from above. </P>
    <DT><B>mail</B>
    <DD>
    <P>Fill in an email address of the initial member. </P></DD></DL>
  <LI>The APCACL object (ActionApps access control storage) (fifth
  block) For this object you need to invent a unique identifier. The identifier
  should consist of 32 characters only containing characters from the set
  <EM>0123456789abcdef</EM>. This is your <EM>aa id</EM>. You will need it later
  again.
  <DL>
    <DT><B>dn</B>
    <DD>
    <P>Replace the string after "apcobjectid=" up to the next comma with your aa
    id. </P>
    <DT><B>apcobjectid</B>
    <DD>
    <P>Replace the content with your aa id. </P>
    <DT><B>description</B>
    <DD>
    <P>Put in "ActionApps at ..." where ... is your organization.
    </P></DD></DL></LI></UL>
<P>Having made these modifications, we can tell the ldap server to create the
objects:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE>% ldapmodify -a -f ldiffile -D "cn=root,dc=ecn,dc=apc,dc=org" -w password

  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>If the server responds with an error message:
<DL>
  <DT><B>ldap_add: Insufficient access</B>
  <DD>
  <P>Check the rootdn: entry in the slapd.conf file and what you typed after the
  -D switch to ldapmodify. They must match. </P>
  <DT><B>ldap_add: Object class violation</B>
  <DD>
  <P>The objects in the ldif file are not consistent. Check if you accidently
  deleted lines from the file. </P></DD></DL>
<P>In order to check the server, search all the objects you just added. The
result should be similar to the ldif file you just used.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE>% ldapsearch -L objectclass=\*
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>If you get an error message or nothing, check the
<CODE>/etc/openldap/ldap.conf</CODE> file for the BASE and HOST entries.
<P>
<H3>LDAP passwords</H3>
<P>There are no less than three passwords we must maintain for the ldap server.
We refer to them as the <EM>root dn password</EM>, which is used to access the
LDAP root account; the <EM>initial superadmin account password</EM>, which is
used to access the initial ActionApps superadmin account; and the
<EM>aalduser account password</EM>, which the ActionApps use to access
the aalduser account and the LDAP server.
<P>We should now set the root dn password in
<CODE>/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</CODE> as well as for the initial superadmin
account password. To do this, first set the initial superadmin account password
using ldappasswd, then make a query to the ldap server so we get an encrypted
version of the password back, and copy and paste the encrypted password into the
sldap.conf file. When you issue the following commands, the password given after
the -w switches must match the <EM>old</EM> root dn password which is still
defined in clear text in <CODE>/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</CODE>. When prompted
for the new password, enter the new root dn password you want to set. And remind
it!
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE>% ldappasswd -D "cn=root,dc=ecn,dc=apc,dc=org" -w password -t "uid=moritz,dc=ecn,dc=apc,dc=org" -H ssha
New password:
Re-enter new password:
% ldapsearch -D "cn=root,dc=ecn,dc=apc,dc=org" -w password -L uid=moritz

objectclass: top
objectclass: person
objectclass: organizationalperson
objectclass: inetorgperson
cn: Moritz Both
sn: Both
uid: moritz
mail: moritz@aldebaran.de
userpassword: {ssha}1KoDEQd/MrY+JPnFgotki5AZrCyfGZYr
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If everything worked right, you get the line "userpassword" as shown. This is
the encrypted version of the new root dn password you entered. Paste this string
(including the "{ssha}") into the rootpw: line in
<CODE>/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</CODE>. After the next server restart, the old
root dn password "password" will no longer work, instead, you use the password
you just entered.
<P>If you want, you can change the password for the initial superadmin account
again so it is different from the root dn password.
<P>Try to access the ldap server using your initial superadmin account:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE>% ldapsearch -D "uid=moritz,dc=ecn,dc=apc,dc=org" -W -L objectclass=\*
Enter LDAP Password:
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>You should get all the objects that are stored. In case of
an error message, check the spelling of the command line... errors most likely
have to do with spelling errors.
<P><B>Finally</B>, set a aalduser account password.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
