<h1>MGETTEXT LANGUAGE FILES README </h1>
<p>(c) Jakub Adámek, Econnect, January 2003 </p>
<p>This directory contains language files used by the mini gettext environment. 
</p>
<p>Each file is connected with one language and a series of PHP scripts. At run-time, 
    you can only use one file for translations at a time, but you can change freely 
    between files by using the<code> bind_mgettext_domain()</code> function in 
    <code>include/mgettext.php3</code>. </p>
<p>The files are maintained by people &#8212; translators and by the PHP function 
    <code>xmgettext()</code> in <code>misc/mgettext/xmgettext.php3</code>. Translators 
    add new translations and xmgettext() adds new strings to be translated which 
    it finds in the source files. </p>
<h2>Notes for Translators </h2>
<p>The language files are regular PHP files, you must not break the syntax. You 
    must not change the ID string in _m["..."]. Even if it contains bad English, 
    it may be changed only in the source code, not in the language file. There 
    is also an English translations file, thus small changes may take place there. 
</p>
<p>You must follow the PHP syntax for strings, using \" and \$ instead of " and 
    $. You must quote the translation with "". (You may quote it with single quotes 
    as well, but next time <code>xmgettext()</code> will be run, it will be changed 
    to double quotes.) </p>
<p>Each language string is preceded by links to source code where it is used. 
    If you are not sure how to translate a string, go to the source code and have 
    a look. Some language strings contain parameters <code>%1,%2 </code>etc. which 
    will be replaced by some variable content at run-time. Place the parameters 
    appropriately in the translation. </p>
<p>The file begins with a list of &quot;Unused messages&quot; which are there 
    only for your convenience so that you may use the text for the new translations 
    if necessary. You can freely delete any unused messages.</p>
<h2>Notes for Developers</h2>
<p>The simple syntax: A string becomes language string by enclosing into <code>_m(&quot; 
    &quot;)</code>, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<code>_m(&quot;any string&quot;)</code>.
</blockquote><p>
It is better to create long strings than to concatenate short ones, because 
    translators may easier understand the meaning. </p>
<p>The parametrized syntax: You must not use variables in language strings. But 
    you can use parameters <code>%1,%2,...</code> with the syntax of </p>
<blockquote> 
    <p><code>_m("... %1 ... %3 ... %2", array ($param1,$param2,$param3))</code>, 
        e.g.<br>
        <br>
        <code>_m("Click on %1 to get more help.", array ($url))</code> or<br>
        <code>_m("Error %1 in file %2 on line %3", array ($err,$file,$line))</code>. 
    </p>
    </blockquote>
<p>Always use the <code>array()</code> even when using only one parameter <code>%1</code>. 
</p>
<p>To update language files, use<code> xmgettext()</code>. Call it by the <code>misc/mgettext/index.php3</code> 
    script. Have a look on particular settings in the script. You need to provide 
    read-write access for PHP to language files in order to update them. Copy 
    them into another directory (I used <code>../php_rw/lang</code>, i.e. not 
    a subdir of the AA installation), set permissions, run <code>xmgettext</code> 
    and copy the updated files back. <em>A side remark: If you don't like this 
    overhead, just remember which overhead it took to create and copy all the 
    L_ language constants to new_news_lang.php3 ...</em> </p>
<p>One more thing to take care of is the run-time switching between languages. 
    If you fill in some include file a global variable with translated strings 
    and than change language, it will remain in the old language. You must create 
    a function returning the variable to avoid this. </p>
<p>Hope you will like my mgettext solution, </p>
