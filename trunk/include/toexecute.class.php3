 *  Then we call misc/toexecute.php3 script from AA cron (say each 2 minutes)
 *  and if there is any task in the queue, it is executed. This way we spread
 *  sending of weeks alerts to thounsands users to several hours.
 *  Ussage:

 *        $object->function_name(param1, param2);
 *    we will use
 *        $toexecute = new AA_Toexecute;

 *
 *        Then we create method $object->toexecutelater(param1, param2)
 *        in which we will call $object->function_name(param1, param2);
 *
 *  The name of 'toexecutelater' method is fixed - This is because of security.
 *  We do not want to allow users to execute any method of any object just
