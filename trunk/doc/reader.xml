    <title>Basic idea</title>

    <para>Readers are users with no AA admin access. I don&#39;t want to use
    the term <quote>users</quote> because of possible confusion with the AA
    users like Authors and more.</para>

    <para>Several modules may be connected with readers:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>Alerts, for sending new items by email</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Authorization (Auth), for HTTP authorization via MySQL_Auth</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>Mailman, for e-mail discussions</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>AA permissions synchronization, which propagates username and
        password changes to the AA permission system</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Readers are identified by email in Alerts and Mailman and by
    username in Auth.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Central point: Slice</title>

    <para>After a lot of discussing and unhappily also a lot of work to be
    thrown off, we have in Econnect decided the best approach to handle Reader
    management will be a slice. It is so simple: each item belongs to one
    person. The individual settings for Alerts, Auth etc. are added as fields
    to the item design.</para>

    <para>Note this means not one slice but several slices, one for each web
    site which uses Alerts, Auth or Mailman. Readers of different web sites
    are in different slices and thus independent. Slice features like item
    feeding may be used when necessary.</para>

    <para>The minimal slice template named Reader Management Minimal is now a
    part of the sql_update script and consists of:</para>

    <table>
      <title>Fields in the Reader Management Minimal template</title>

      <tgroup cols="2">
        <tbody>
          <row>
            <entry>Username</entry>

            <entry>Used in the Authorization (Auth) module</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>Email</entry>

            <entry>Required for Alerts and Mailman modules. For each Reader
            Management slice either username or email should be flagged as
            required.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>Password</entry>

            <entry>If the web uses Auth, this is the HTTP password. Otherwise
            this password must be filled in the anonymous form every time a
            reader wants to change his or her personal details.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>First / Last name</entry>

            <entry>Not required, may be used to personalize emails.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>Email Confirmed</entry>

            <entry>This box is automatically checked after the reader clicks
            on a link including the Access Code (see below). No reader
            receives any Alert email until it is checked.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry><anchor id="access_code" />Access Code</entry>

            <entry>This code is received in emails as a part of a URL. By
            clicking on this URL a reader confirms his or her email address.
            The URL points to reader personal details. On webs not using Auth
            this is the only way to edit personal details.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>Remark</entry>

            <entry>Any remark, may or may not be a part of the personal
            details shown to readers.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>Start date</entry>

            <entry>Membership start, readers are disabled before this point
            for all related modules.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>Expiry date</entry>

            <entry>Membership finish, readers are disabled after this point.</entry>
          </row>
        </tbody>
      </tgroup>
    </table>

    <para>Slice administrators create new slice based on this template and may
    add any number of further fields, which is the main advantage of using a
    slice for Reader Management.</para>

    <para>The Alerts module adds automatically its own fields, with special
    field IDs linking to the module, e.g. <constant>alerts1....4e4c7</constant>
    for <quote>how often</quote> and Alerts Collection with ID
    <constant>4e4c7</constant>.</para>

    <para>One Reader management slice may be connected with several modules,
    usually belonging to the same web site. Suppose you create a site with
    HTTP restricted access. You may provide an Authorization module and two
    different Alerts Collections. They all link to the same reader group and
    thus use the same Reader management slice.</para>

    <para>In the simplest cases, there will be one Reader management slice +
    one Alerts or Auth module. The Alerts or Auth module will always use
    (almost) directly the slice data.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Editing Reader Info: Anonymous posting form</title>

    <para>As readers do not have access to the AA control panel, they must
    edit their personal details on the <ulink role="html" url="anonym.html">Anonymous
    posting form, described in another document</ulink>.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Module common behaviour</title>

    <para>Only readers in Active bin will receive Alerts, be allowed to pages
    guarded by Authorization etc.</para>

    <para>In special cases, when you want to stop web access for some reader
    (authorization) but don&#39;t want to stop him or her receiving Alerts,
    you must create a dummy authorization group and assign this group to him
    or her.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Module specific behaviour</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Alerts specific behaviour</title>

      <para>The Alerts module appears like other regular modules in the slice
      select box. It offers these pages:</para>

      <table>
        <title>Alerts menu</title>

        <tgroup cols="2">
          <tbody>
            <row>
              <entry>Alerts Settings</entry>

              <entry>Core settings for the Alerts module, see below.</entry>
            </row>

            <row>
              <entry>Selections</entry>

              <entry>Choose which selections you want to show and their order.
              Selections are defined in views of type Alerts Selection Set in
              the slices from which you want to send new items. Each selection
              has a description and a set of the powerful
              <constant>conds[]</constant> and <constant>sort[]</constant>
              parameters, the same as are used with <constant>slice.php3</constant>
              in search forms. Mind that if some item appears in several
              selections, it will be repeated in the mail. Try to make
              selections mutually exclusive. You can send an example email
              from the Design page to yourself to see exactly what readers
              receive. And you can manually send the daily, weekly or monthly
              digest to all readers.</entry>
            </row>

            <row>
              <entry>Sync With Reader Slice</entry>

              <entry>Sets the Reader Management Slice which feeds this Alerts.
              Allows to add, delete and refresh the Alerts-specific fields to
              the slice. When you change the list on the Selections page, use
              Sync to refresh the appropriate constant group in the Reader
              Management Slice.</entry>
            </row>

            <row>
              <entry>Email Templates</entry>

              <entry>Allows to edit all email templates.</entry>
            </row>
          </tbody>
        </tgroup>
      </table>

      <para>The fields added by Sync with reader slice are:</para>

      <table>
        <title>Alerts specific fields</title>

        <tgroup cols="2">
          <tbody>
            <row>

              <entry>How often the reader receives a digest: instant (each new
              item in one e-mail), daily, weekly, monthly.</entry>

              from the collection the reader wants to read. New parameters of
              the Multiple Checkboxes field Input type allow to view them in a
              table, see the Parameter Wizard.</entry>
            </row>
          </tbody>
        </tgroup>
      </table>

      <para>You may show <emphasis>how often</emphasis> or
      <emphasis>choose selections </emphasis>in the anonymous forms or you may
      set defaults by hidden fields.</para>

      <para>The core settings in Alerts Admin - Settings include these special
      fields:</para>

      <table>
        <title>Alerts Settings</title>

        <tgroup cols="2">
          <tbody>
            <row>
              <entry>form URL</entry>

              <entry>The URL to your pages with the <quote>Change personal
              details</quote> form. This URL is used to create the
              <constant>_#COLLFORM</constant> alias.</entry>
            </row>

            <row>
              <entry>welcome email</entry>

              <entry>A link to the email template for a message sent to new
              users on subscription. The edit icon on the right allows you to
              jump to the email edit form.</entry>
            </row>

            <row>
              <entry>alert email</entry>

              <entry>A link to the email template of the alert sent instant /
              daily / ... and containing new items.</entry>
            </row>
          </tbody>
        </tgroup>
      </table>

      <para>The email templates (welcome and alert) are stored in the common
      table <constant>email</constant> and are defined using aliases and alias
      functions. This allows a completely free design. The formatted new items
      are added by the <constant>_#FILTERS_</constant> alias. If you want to
      send different texts to readers with different <quote>how often</quote>,
      use the <constant>switch</constant> function on the alias
      <constant>_#HOWOFTEN</constant>. To allow readers to confirm their email
      and change their personal settings, use the alias <constant>_#COLLFORM</constant>,
      which is the URL you filled in Alerts Admin - Settings, with an
      additional 9 letters parameter containing the <link
      linkend="access_code">access code</link>.</para>

        <para>The Auth feature (it is not a real module) is meant to be used

        install this module on your web server to appreciate the Auth feature.
        There are several versions of the module with different option names.
        Find the correct ones in your version. This is the info you will need:</para>

        <title>Auth feature</title>

        <para>The Auth administration includes creating membership types
        (meta-groups) and assigning (sub)groups to them. This may be achieved
        with the usage of AA constants, where the constant name is the
        membership type and the constant value are the subgroups assigned to
        individual folders, separated by semicolon.</para>

        <para>For example, if you want to create Standard Membership and
        Privileged Membership, where the first is permitted to folders
        &#34;main&#34; and &#34;search&#34; and the second to &#34;main&#34;,
        &#34;search&#34; and &#34;privileged&#34;, you create these two
        constants:</para>

            </tbody>
          </tgroup>
        </table>

        <para>The user / membership type assignments are synchronized with
        tables <constant>auth_user</constant> and <constant>auth_group</constant>
        using event handlers for events like updating an item or moving the
        item into another bin. Also you should check <quote>Propagate changes
        into current items</quote> in the constant group because then if you
        change the subgroups, all user-group assignments for that metagroup
        are updated even in the <constant>auth_group</constant> table.</para>

        <para>To avoid the conflict of another Reader Management slice using
        the same subgroup names, I recommend to use some pre- or postfix (like
        <quote>myreaders_</quote> in my example).</para>

        <para>When you have created the constant group, create a field of type
        <quote>Auth Group</quote> and assign the constant group to it.</para>

        <para>The Auth feature is set on and off using a new item in Slice
        Settings, named <quote>Auth Group Field</quote>, with the name of the
        field mentioned above. This setting is visible only in Reader
        Management slices created from the Reader Management Minimal template
        (<emphasis>exactly, only for slices of type <constant>ReaderManagement</constant></emphasis>).</para>

        <para>Only when <quote>Auth Group Field</quote> is filled, the slice
        is synchronized with the auth_user/group tables.</para>

        <para>You may set to which bin new readers are put on subscription
        with the standard &#34;Allow anonymous posting of items&#34; setting.</para>

        <para>Because readers are assigned to items, they may appear in
        Pending or Expired bin depending on Start date and Expiry date
        settings. You should run the script <constant>auth_maintain.php3?maintain_auth=1</constant>
        once a day by cron to automatically add or delete users moved to or
        from the Active bin.</para>

      <title>Mailman specific behaviour</title>

      <para>You can manage mailing lists with the Mailman feature. The idea is
      to use a directory accessible both to PHP and to mailman. AA maintain
      files with names being the mailing list names, each file contains a list
      of email addresses subscribed to the list, one on a row. Mailman reads
      these files regularly to synchronize the real mailing lists.</para>

      <para>To use this feature, follow these steps:</para>

    <title>Discussion - Why to use slice?</title>

    <para>The main reason to use slice was that we need some reader management
    with the possibility to add any new fields. This is exactly what slice
    does. Also, we can use many other nice features already developed for
    slice. And last but not least if we need to improve the current slice
    interface to better support Reader management, this will be useful for all
    other slices as well. This is for example the case of Anonymous forms.</para>
