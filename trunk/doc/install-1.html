<H2><A name=s1>1. Introduction</A></H2>
<H2><A name=ss1.1>1.1 Overview</A> </H2>
<P>The APC ActionApps provide easy automated publishing for non-profit
WWW sites and 'Usenet-like' sharing of articles between sites.
<P>ActionApps consist of
<UL>
  <LI>actual www pages which display the content. These pages can be designed
  individually. At one spot, they contain an "include" directive which is
  automatically replaced by the current content whenever a user requests this
  page, and
  <LI>a database engine including a permission system, a storage and a content
  managing system. This system has a www interface and administrators, editors
  and authors of a certain page can do their work completely using that
  interface. </LI></UL>
<P>
<H2><A name=slices></A><A name=ss1.2>1.2 Slices</A> </H2>
<P>ActionApps provide something called <EM>slices</EM> which represent
one <EM>application</EM> each. Each application/slice has its own content, its
own configuration, permissions, and so on. If you run the ActionApps on
a server, you can set up such slices for your users and grant individual
<EM>slice administration rights</EM>. Users are then administering their
respective slices in every way.
<P>Slices are usually based on Templates, the most common of which is the News
  template.
<H2><A name=ss1.3>1.3 Users, Roles and Permissions</A> </H2>
<P>ActionApps provides its own user management engine. Authentication
and authorization are implemented by a permission system which supports two
different back ends: LDAP and SQL. You are free to choose which back end you
want to use. In either case, it is possible to create groups of users and groups
of groups. Privileges which are granted to the group will be promoted to all its
members.
<P>There are five roles:
<DL>
  <DT><B>Reader.</B>
  <DD>
  <P>Readers do not need to have user accounts in the ActionApps
  permission system. Most of the times, they actually do not realize that they
  have to do with something like the ActionApps. They just view regular
  WWW pages and can read the information provided by the ActionApps
  slice owners. </P>
  <DT><B>Author.</B>
  <DD>
  <P>Authors must have user accounts in the ActionApps permission
  system. The role "author" is bound to a certain slice. Any ActionApps
  user who has "author" privileges for an ActionApps slice can submit
  new information items for this slice and remove and edit her own submissions.
  </P>
  <DT><B>Editor.</B>
  <DD>
  <P>Editors must have user accounts in the ActionApps permission
  system. The role "editor" is bound to a certain slice. An ActionApps
  user who has "editor" privileges for an ActionApps slice can do
  everything an author for this slice can. Additionally, she can pick items from
  other slices, and edit, approve or expire every item her slice, which includes
  other authors' items, as well. An editor has full control over items which
  were published in her slice, but cannot modify the full text of items imported
  from other slices (the so called ?fed items?). </P>
  <DT><B>Administrator.</B>
  <DD>
  <P>Administrators must have user accounts in the ActionApps
  permission system. The role "administrator" is bound to a certain slice. An
  ActionApps user who has "administrator" privileges for an Action
  Applications slice can do everything an editor for this slice can.
  Additionally, she can set or change the configuration of her slice. The
  administrator can design the layout of the web site, define which categories
  are used in the slice and from and to which other slices items are shared. She
  also sets which parameters are predefined and which can be modified by the
  authors/editors of the slice. </P>
  <DT><B>Super Administrator.</B>
  <DD>
  <P>Super administrators must have user accounts in the ActionApps
  permission system. The role "super administrator" is <EM>not</EM> bound to a
  slice. Super administrators (superadmins) can do everything. This means, they
  can do anything a slice administrator can, but for <EM>every</EM> slice;
  additionally, they can add slices to the system. </P></DD></DL>
<P>Permission management can generally be done by everyone for roles below their
own level.

<H2><A name=ss1.4>1.4 ActionApps Software Components</A> </H2>
<P>ActionApps consist of several software components. Only one of them
is provided by the APC ActionApps package:
<UL>
  <LI>The APC ActionApps software. These are basically a set of PHP
  scripts running within a web server.
  <LI>A database server. The database server does not have to be on the same
  host as the other components. It can be used for other applications as well.
  <LI>Users and passwords in ActionApplications can be stored in a number
  of different 'back-ends' such as mysql, LDAP, and even an IMAP-server.
  The default system, and the simplest to setup, is mysql.  If you want to
  use and alternate permission-system back-end, such as LDAP, you will need to
  have these packages installed.
  <LI>A WWW Server. The WWW Server provides the access from the network via the
  http protocol. It runs the ActionApps programs whenever someone
  accesses the ActionApps controlled pages.
  <LI>PHP3. The PHP interpreter is needed to execute the ActionApps PHP
  scripts. </LI></UL>See section <A
href="install-2.html#requirements">Requirements /
Preconditions / Suggested Environment</A> for details about the installation of
all the components.

<H2><A name=ss1.5>1.5 Conventions used in this document</A> </H2>
<P>Command line input is shown including the command line prompt so it is clear
which lines should be typed in. The prompt indicates if a command should be run
as a normal user or as root: For normal users, the prompt is <CODE>%</CODE>, and
for root, the prompt is <CODE>#</CODE>.
<P>An example is shown below:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE>% uptime
