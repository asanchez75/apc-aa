<H2><A name=s4>4. Installation of Action Applications</A></H2>
<H2><A name=ss4.1>4.1 Installation</A> </H2>
<P>APC-AA software is just a bunch of php scripts - human (though php savvy) readable files. There no binaries or anything else to be worried about. The whole installation task means getting the files and copy them into some directory. There are two options how to install APC-AA. You can either: <br>
<p>
 - download latest CVS version via cvs <br>
 - download the latest stable version in zipped format <br>
   
<p>Installing the Action Apps via CVS makes it easy to update later. The problem is that CVS repository is mainly intended for developers and thus always contains latest development version, which doesn't always have to be stable, and may contain bugs. On the other hand, you will get latest features and known bug fixes. The rule-of-thumb is if you need fetures that are currently being developed, than use CVS. If it's quite unlikely that you will need to update APC-AA very often, than stick on stable releases. 
<p>
 The exact details will depend on whether your machine is serving
  multiple Virtual Domains and if so, whether Action Apps is to be made available 
  to all the domains or not. 
<P>Action Apps can be installed either in some common location, or inside one 
  of the Virtual Hosts, the example below assumes that Action Apps is installed 
  in a common location, &quot;/home/httpd/&quot;
<H3><A name=ss4.1.1>4.1.1 Installing via CVS for developers</a></h3>
<P>Developers should check the <a href="//http://apc-aa.sourceforge.net/faq/#234">FAQ item</a> for an alternative.
<H3><A name=ss4.1.2>4.1.2 Installing via CVS for non-developers</a></h3>
<p>If you are installing from CVS repository, you must have cvs utility installed on your machine. Check: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
  </CODE> 
  <PRE><code>
# rpm -q cvs
# cvs-1.11.1p1-7</code></pre>
  <code>

<P> CVS will automatically create the installation directory for you named APC-AA.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
  </CODE> 
  <PRE><code># cd /home/httpd/
# cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.apc-aa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/apc-aa login<br># press enter at the password prompt    <br># cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.apc-aa.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/apc-aa co apc-aa</code></PRE>
   <code>

  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><i>There is a <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-cvs@gnu.org/msg01322.html">bug</a>
in the current version of CVS 1.11, if you see the error "failed to open ~/.cvspass for reading: No such file or directory"
when doing the login, then "touch ~/.cvspass" and try again.</i>
<H3><A name=ss4.1.3>4.1.3 Installing the stable release via FTP</a></h3>
<P>If you want to install the latest stable version rather than the one from CVS, download it from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/apc-aa/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/apc-aa/</a> to the hard drive (let's say to <code>/tmp</code>) and than untar 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
  </CODE>
  <PRE><code>  # cd /home/httpd/
  #  tar -xvzf /tmp/apc-aa-2.2.0.tgz </code></PRE>
  <code>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
This will create directory /home/httpd/apc-aa-2.2.0, which you can rename to apc-aa or whatever is convenient for you.<p></P>
<P>If you have no shell access on the machine, then you can download this code, and FTP it into a directory on your web site</P>
<P>If you want Action Apps available to all domains, then add this line in the 
  global context with the other Aliases, otherwise you can add it to each Virtual 
  domain where you want to make Action Apps available. 
<P>Note that you do NOT need to do this for a virtual domain IF Action Apps is 
  installed directly in that domains web site.

<H3><A name=ss4.1.4>4.1.4 Configuring Action Applications</A></H3>
<P>Edit <CODE>/home/httpd/html/apc-aa/include/config.php3</CODE>.
<P>This is the main Action Applications configuration file. It contains comments 
  which explain everything there. Note that this file may not contain anything 
  before the <CODE>&lt;?php</CODE> line at the top and after the <CODE>?&gt;</CODE>
  line at the bottom.
<P><i>(Need to document how to work with site_config instead</I></P>
<P><B>The file <CODE>/home/httpd/html/apc-aa/include/config.php3</CODE> now contains 
  passwords. It should therefore not be world readable. On the other hand, the 
  http server must be able to read it. Read the chapter on <A 
href="install-6.html#security">security</A> for a possible solution for this problem.</B> 
<h2><a name=ss4.2>4.2 Creating the database</a></h2>
<p>There are two options depending on whether you have shell access, or are
running on an ISP's setup.</p>
<h3><a name=ss4.2.1>4.2.1 No shell access: Asking the ISP</a></h3>
<p>Ask the ISP to: 
<blockquote>
Create a mysql database called "aadb", and a mysql user with permission to 
 CREATE,DROP,ALTER,SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE  on this database. 
They should know what this means, and understand it presents no security implications.
</blockquote>
<h3><a name=ss4.2.2></a>4.2.2 Shell access: creating it yourself</h3>

<p>Then create your initial Action Applications database. When queried for a password, use the mysql root password. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <hr>
  <pre><code>#  mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE aadb;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)

mysql&gt; QUIT
Bye
</code></pre>
  <hr>
</blockquote>

<p>Create a user in MySQL that will be able to access the new aadb database. Note 
  that the instructions below assumed you used &quot;localhost&quot; as the MySQL 
  server, if you set something else, then it will typically be something like
  &quot;aadbuser@machinename&quot;. This username and password should match that 
  set in config.php3 above. We will refer to this password as the <em>aadbuser
  password</em>.
<blockquote>
  <hr>
  <pre><code># mysql -u root -p
mysql&gt; USE mysql;
mysql&gt; GRANT CREATE,DROP,ALTER,SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE
ON aadb.* 
TO aadbuser@localhost
IDENTIFIED BY 'password2';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)

mysql&gt; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql&gt; quit
</code></pre>
</blockquote>






<P> 
<H2><A name=ss4.3>4.3 Initializing the database and creating a superadmin account</A> 
</H2>
<P>&nbsp;
Once the database and account are created, point your Web browser to <a href="http://localhost/apc-aa/sql_update.php3">http://localhost/apc-aa/sql_update.php3</a>. 
If there are any error messages (which will show up in bold) these are typically 
because the ISP has failed to give you one of the database permissions requested 
above, or has set up authentication for the database wrongly. 
<P>Point your Web browser to <a
href="http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/setup.php3">http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/setup.php3</a>. 
  You should see a page with two buttons &quot;Init&quot; and &quot;Recover&quot;, 
  click &quot;Init&quot; and you should receive a form where you can enter the 
  information for the SuperAdmin account. 
<P>If you don't get the form, just the same screen again, then check your php settings
  if &quot;register_globals = On&quot; as described in <a href="install-3.html#ss3.7">3.7</a>.
<p>
<P>There is just one question open: What is login name and password of the initial
  superadmin account (which you need to create the first slice)? The answer depends
  on the permission system you use.
<p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are using the LDAP based permission system, the superadmin account
    is the one you created when you edited the initial LDIF data file. At that
    time, you have also set a password for this account.
  <li>If you are using the sql based permission system, there is no initial superadmin
    account so far. To create one, follow the instructions below. </li>
</ul>
<p>Action Applications users who have the superadmin privilege may create new
  slices in addition to the rights any slice administrator has.
<p>Creating a superadmin account will be necessary whenever you don't have one
  left. This is the case at installation time if you are using the sql based permission
  system, and in case you have accidently deleted the last superadmin account
  or accidently revoked the superadmin privilege from the last superadmin account.
  To create a superadmin account, follow these steps.
<ul>
  <li>rename the file apc-aa/admin/setup.php.txt to apc-aa/admin/setup.php
  <li>go to <a
href="http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/sliceadd.php3">http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/setup.php3</a>
    and press &quot;Recover&quot;
  <li>rename the file apc-aa/admin/setup.php back to apc-aa/admin/setup.php.txt
    for safety.
</ul>
<H2><A name=ss4.4>4.4 File uploads and cron</A> </H2>
<p>If you want people to be able to use file uploads, you have to create a directory where apache server can store
 uploaded files, and which will accessible via the webserver. To do this,
create the directory under one of your sites, or create it somewhere else and
create an alias in httpd.conf to point at it. Make sure this directory is
the apache web server has write permissions for this directory. Look for lines like <br>
<pre><code>

User apache
Group apache

</code></pre>

in your httpd.conf file in order to find out under which identity is your web server running.
Than set the right permisions. Example:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
  </CODE>
  <PRE><code>
  # mkdir /var/www/uploads
  # chown apache:apache /var/www/uploads
  # chmod 775 /var/www/uploads/
  </code></PRE>
  <code>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


<p>Edit apc-aa/include/config.php3, edit the defines IMG_UPLOAD_PATH and IMG_UPLOAD_URL to point to this directory. Note the trailing "/". IMG_UPLOAD_TYPE allows you to specify what MIME types you will allow people to upload.
<p>To stop someone uploading a PHP file and then executing it, edit your httpd.conf file and add 

<BLOCKQUOTE><HR><PRE><CODE>
<Directory "/home/httpd/html/apc-aa-uploads">
 Options None
 php_flag engine off
</Directory>
</CODE></PRE><HR></BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
For installing cron, please refer to the <a href=http://apc-aa.sourceforge.net/faq/>FAQ</a> page.

<P>
<H2><A name=ss4.5>4.5 Your first test slice</A> </H2>
<p>After creating the superadmin you will be thanked and either directed to the
  Slice addition page <a
href="http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/sliceadd.php3">http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/sliceadd.php3</a>
  or direct to the Administration front end <a
href="http://localhost/apc-aa/admin/index.php3">http://localhost/apc-aa/admin</a>.
  You should be able to log in now with the superadmin account you created above.
  Refer to the <a href="http://www.apc.org/actionapps/english/manual/wmguide.html">APC
  Action Apps User Manual Webmaster's guide</a>.
