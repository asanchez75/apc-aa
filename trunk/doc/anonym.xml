  <abstract>
    <para>Explains the basic idea, creation and settings of Anonymous forms.
    The name <quote>anonymous</quote> is in some cases not accurate, as the
    form is used for reader personal info and the readers must be authorized
    to edit their own info.</para>

    <title>General usage of Anonymous Forms</title>

    <para>Anonymous forms are similar in function and design to the Add / Edit
    item page. The main difference is they are placed outside of the AA
    Control Panel and thus do not provide the AA authorization and have a
    design of their own.</para>

    <para>The most common usage is to allow web readers to suggest new
    content. After filling the Anonymous form it is sent to the Holding Bin
    and a <emphasis>Thank you</emphasis> page appears. But you can also allow
    readers to edit items with the Anonymous form.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Creating Anonymous Forms with the Wizard</title>

    <para>In the previous AA versions until version 2.4, the process of
    creating Anonymous forms was very simple: Copy the code of the
    <quote>Add item</quote> page with only a few necessary changes. But as the
    form now allows to edit items and to use several options for it, a new
    wizard was created. This wizard creates the code for a complete form with
    the SSI include of <constant>fillform.php3</constant> necessary to edit
    items. Use some feature like <quote>Show source code</quote> in your
    browser to get the code. The resulting form differs depending on whether
    Anonymous editing is allowed or not.</para>

    <para>You may change these settings sent in anonymous fields:</para>

    <table>
      <title>Some hidden fields in the anonymous form</title>

      <tgroup cols="2">
        <tbody>
          <row>
            <entry>err_url</entry>

            <entry>The URL to which the script <constant>filler.php3</constant>
            jumps when some error occurs. It may be the same page on which the
            form is shown.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>ok_url</entry>

            <entry>Like err_url, for successful changes.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>show_result</entry>

            <entry>The URL of a PHP script which receives the results from
            <constant>filler.php3</constant>. This allows for a completely
            free design of how the errors are presented to the user. See <link
            linkend="show_results">below</link>.</entry>
          </row>
        </tbody>
      </tgroup>
    </table>

    <para>If you are interested to know more about what the form contains,
    here are some remarks:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>The fields shown in AA but not shown in the anonymous form
        are mentioned in the <constant>notshown[v7377697463682e2e2e2e2e2e2e2e2e2e]</constant>
        hidden variables. This is to allow to set these fields to default
        values on posting and to store old values on updating.</simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>The setting <constant>use_post2shtml</constant> allows to use
        the POST method for the form even though it is on a shtml page. The
        values are stored in the database and restored by the scripts. This is
        very useful as the GET method allows only for a restricted capacity
        and shows the values in the URL.</simpara>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title><anchor id="edit_options" />Editing with anonymous forms</title>

    <para>If you want to edit items with anonymous forms, first you must allow
    to choose which item to edit. You can create a view and add a link to the
    headlines, which links to the anonymous form and contains the parameter
    <constant>my_item_id=_#ITEM_ID_</constant>. Another approach is used in
    Reader management slices, see below.</para>

    <para>You must choose the correct setting in Slice Admin - Settings -
    Allow anonymous editing of items, which is used by the
    <constant>filler.php3</constant> script on an item update request. The
    options are:</para>

    <table>
      <title>Anonymous editing options</title>

      <tgroup cols="2">
        <tbody>
          <row>
            <entry>Not allowed</entry>

            <entry>Never allow to update items</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>All items</entry>

            <entry>Always allow</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>Only items posted anonymously</entry>

            <entry>For items posted anonymously, <constant>filler</constant>
            always sets the <constant>ITEM_FLAG_ANONYMOUS_EDITABLE</constant>
            flag. By choosing this option you allow only items with this flag
            set to be edited.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>Only items posted anonymously and not edited in AA</entry>

            <entry>Similar to the previous one, but when you edit the item in
            the control panel, the flag is cleared and thus the item is no
            more allowed to be edited anonymously.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>Authorized by a password field</entry>

            <entry><constant>filler</constant> looks for a field of type
            Password (with Id beginning with <constant>password....</constant>)
            and requests the password sent by the user to match. The password
            may be set on item creation. If the field is not flagged required,
            an empty password may be used. The new Field Input Type, Field
            Insert Function and Field Validate Functions <quote>Password and
            Change Password</quote> provide the usual edit boxes for changing,
            deleting and entering password, which is stored encrypted. The
            disadvantage is the password must be sent on every update.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>Readers, authorized by HTTP auth</entry>

            <entry>This is a special option, useful only for Reader management
            slices. The username given to the browser on HTTP authentification
            is looked for in the database. Each reader may edit only his or
            her personal info.</entry>
          </row>
        </tbody>
      </tgroup>
    </table>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>Reader management specifics</title>

    <para>Each reader has her or his own item in the Reader management slice.
    Thus the HTTP authentication described above may be used directly to
    determine which item (reader personal details) to show in the form.</para>

    <para>In this case two forms are needed, one being the publicly accessible
    subscribe form and the second being the HTTP protected <quote>Change
    personal details</quote> form. Because the fields on both the forms may be
    the same, you can use one form and include it into two different .shtml
    pages.</para>

    <para>For webs not using Auth we need a way to ensure nobody not only
    edits but even views the data. This is achieved by assigning a special
    <quote>Access Code</quote> (<ulink role="html" url="reader.html">see the
    Reader management documentation</ulink>) to each reader, which must be
    added to the URL in order that the data are prefilled. The password
    authorization described above is than used on item update.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title><anchor id="show_results" />Show results</title>

    <para>Sending the data to AA results in adding the data into database or
    in an error. Some of the errors may be excluded in advance by Javascript,
    which does not allow to send an errornous form. But some of them, like a
    username being already used, can not.</para>

    <para>You may create your own PHP script (see an example in
    <constant>doc/script/show_result.php3</constant>) and send its URL as a
    value of a <constant>show_result</constant> variable. Add it as a
    parameter to the <constant>fillform.php3</constant> SSI include created by
    the Wizard, e.g. <screen>&#60;!--#include virtual=&#34;/aaa/fillform.php3?show_result=http://ecn.cz/show_result.php3&#38;form=...&#34;--&#62;</screen>An
    array <constant>$result</constant> with the results will be sent to the
    PHP script and you may show appropriate messages. If you do not send
    <constant>show_result</constant>, the <constant>fillform.php3</constant>
    script shows the standard messages. Mind the messages will appear on the
    place where <constant>fillform.php3</constant> is SSI-included in your
    shtml page.</para>

    <para>The <constant>$result</constant> array content is created at various
    places in <constant>filler.php3</constant> as the <constant>$err[]</constant>
    array. Look there for accurate info. At this moment the messages are:</para>

    <table>
      <title>Results from filler.php3</title>

      <tgroup cols="2">
        <tbody>
          <row>
            <entry>fatal</entry>

            <entry>Fatal error. Several messages related to the slice, not to
            the particular item. These errors help on creating the web page.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>validate</entry>

            <entry>Array with not validated fields, <constant>field_id =&#62;
            message</constant>, e.g. <constant>headline........ =&#62; This
            username is already used</constant> created on field validation.
            You may create your own messages depending on the
            <constant>field_id</constant>.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>permissions</entry>

            <entry>Missing permissions. Depending on the setting for Anonymous
            editing (<link linkend="edit_options">see above</link>), this item
            did not fullfill the requirements.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>store</entry>

            <entry>Some error in StoreItem. Usually this points to an inner AA
            error.</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>success</entry>

            <entry>No error. The operation was successfully done. The value is
            <quote>insert</quote> or <quote>update</quote> (i.e.
            <constant>$result[&#34;success&#34;] == &#34;insert&#34;</constant>
            or <constant>$result[&#34;success&#34;] == &#34;update&#34;</constant>
            in the show results script).</entry>
          </row>

          <row>
            <entry>email_confirmed</entry>

            <entry>Added by <constant>fillform.php3</constant> on Reader
            management slices: When the reader successfully confirms his or
            her email by using the URL sent in an email, <constant>fillform</constant>
            adds a message <quote>email_confirmed =&#62; OK</quote>. This
            message is added only when the email has not yet been confirmed.</entry>
          </row>
        </tbody>
      </tgroup>
    </table>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Discussion</emphasis>: A similar result may be
    achieved by adding several fields to the form, e.g. fields
    <screen>err_page[validate][username......]=&#34;err_username.shtml&#34;
err_page[validate][*]=&#34;err_validate.shtml&#34;
err_page[*]=&#34;err_unrecognized.shtml&#34;</screen>and by creating the
    .shtml pages with a static message concerning the particular error. The
    main advantage of this approach is the web administrator may not know PHP.
    The disadvantage is the necessity of creating many pages but using SSI
    includes the pages could look only like:<screen>&#60;!--#include file=&#34;err_top.shtml&#34;--&#62;
The username you entered has already been used. Please try another username.
&#60;!--#include file=&#34;err_bottom.shtml&#34;--&#62;</screen></para>
