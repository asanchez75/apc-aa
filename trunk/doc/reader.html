I don't want to use
    the term &#8220;users&#8221; because of possible confusion with the AA
    users like Authors and more.</p><p>Several modules may be connected with readers:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Alerts, for sending new items by email</li><li>Authorization (Auth), for HTTP authorization via MySQL_Auth</li><li>Mailman, for e-mail discussions</li></ul></div><p>Readers are identified by email in Alerts and Mailman and by
    username in Auth.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e47"></a>Central point: Slice</h2></div></div><p>After a lot of discussing and unhappily also a lot of work to be
    thrown off, we have in Econnect decided the best approach to handle Reader
    management will be a slice. It is so simple: each item belongs to one
    person. The individual settings for Alerts, Auth etc. are added as fields
    to the item design.</p><p>The minimal slice template named Reader Management Minimal is now a
    part of the sql_update script and consists of:</p><div class="table"><p><b>Table 1. Fields in the Reader Management Minimal template</b></p><table summary="Fields in the Reader Management Minimal template" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>Username</td><td>Used in the Authorization (Auth) module</td></tr><tr><td>Email</td><td>Required for Alerts and Mailman modules. For each Reader
            Management slice either username or email should be flagged as
            required.</td></tr><tr><td>Password</td><td>If the web uses Auth, this is the HTTP password. Otherwise
            this password must be filled in the anonymous form every time a
            reader wants to change his or her personal details.</td></tr><tr><td>First / Last name</td><td>Not required, may be used to personalize emails.</td></tr><tr><td>Email Confirmed</td><td>This box is automatically checked after the reader clicks
            on a link including the Access Code (see below). No reader
            receives any Alert email until it is checked.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="access_code"></a>Access Code</td><td>This code is received in emails as a part of a URL. By
            clicking on this URL a reader confirms his or her email address.
            The URL points to reader personal details. On webs not using Auth
            this is the only way to edit personal details.</td></tr><tr><td>Remark</td><td>Any remark, may or may not be a part of the personal
            details shown to readers.</td></tr><tr><td>Start date</td><td>Membership start, readers are disabled before this point
            for all related modules.</td></tr><tr><td>Expiry date</td><td>Membership finish, readers are disabled after this point.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Slice administrators create new slice based on this template and may
    add any number of further fields, which is the main advantage of using a
    slice for Reader Management.</p><p>The Alerts module adds automatically its own fields, with special
    field IDs linking to the module, e.g. <tt>alerts1....4e4c7</tt>
    for &#8220;how often&#8221; and Alerts Collection with ID
    <tt>4e4c7</tt>.</p><p>One Reader management slice may be connected with several modules,
    usually belonging to the same web site. Suppose you create a site with
    HTTP restricted access. You may provide an Authorization module and two
    different Alerts Collections. They all link to the same reader group and
    thus use the same Reader management slice.</p><p>In the simplest cases, there will be one Reader management slice +
    one Alerts or Auth module. The Alerts or Auth module will always use
    (almost) directly the slice data.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e122"></a>Editing Reader Info: Anonymous posting form</h2></div></div><p>As readers do not have access to the AA control panel, they must
    edit their personal details on the Anonymous posting form.</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e127"></a>General usage of Anonymous Forms</h3></div></div><p>Anonymous posting forms are similar in function and design to the
      Add / Edit item page. The main difference is they are placed outside of
      AA Control Panel and thus do not provide the AA authorization and have a
      design of their own.</p><p>The most common usage is to allow web readers to suggest new
      content. After filling the Anonymous Form it is sent to the Holding Bin
      and a <span class="emphasis"><em>Thank you</em></span> page appears.</p><p>But you can also allow readers to edit items with the Anonymous
      Form. Two types of authorization are provided: Basically only items
      posted from an Anonymous Form and not updated in the Control Panel are
      allowed to be edited. <span class="emphasis"><em>This is ensured by a special flag
      ITEM_FLAG_ANONYMOUS_EDITABLE which is cleared on every update in the
      Control Panel.</em></span></p><p>The second possibility is to add a Password field to the item. The
      new Field Input Type, Field Insert Function and Field Validate Functions
      &#8220;Password and Change Password&#8221; provide the usual edit boxes
      for changing, deleting and entering password, which is stored encrypted.
      If a password-protected item is edited and a password is set for this
      item, it must be sent on every update.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e146"></a>Reader management specifics</h3></div></div><p>Each reader has her or his own item in the Reader management
      slice. Thus the HTTP authentication may be used directly to determine
      which item (reader personal details) to show in the form. This is
      achieved by sending the <tt>use_http_auth=1</tt> setting to
      <tt>fillform.php3</tt>.</p><p>In this case two forms are needed, one being the publicly
      accessible subscribe form and the second being the HTTP protected
      &#8220;Change personal details&#8221; form. Because the fields on both
      the forms may be the same, you can use one form and include it into two
      different .shtml pages.</p><p>For webs not using Auth we need a way to ensure nobody not only
      edits but even views the data. This is achieved by assigning a special
      &#8220;Access Code&#8221; (<a href="#access_code">see above</a>)
      to each reader, which must be added to the URL in order that the data
      are prefilled.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e170"></a>Show results</h3></div></div><p>Sending the data to AA results in adding the data into database or
      in an error. Some of the errors may be excluded by Javascript, which
      does not allow to send an errornous form. But some of them, like a
      username being already used, can't.</p><p>You may create your own PHP script and send its URL as a value of
      a <tt>show_result</tt> variable. An array with the errors
      will be sent to the script and you may view them in your own design. If
      you do not send <tt>show_result</tt>, the
      <tt>fillform.php3</tt> script shows them.</p><p>TODO: details on the array content.</p><p><span class="bold"><b>Discussion</b></span>: A similar result may
      be achieved by adding several fields to the form, e.g. fields
      <pre class="screen">err_page[validate][username......]="err_username.shtml"
err_page[validate][*]="err_validate.shtml"
err_page[*]="err_unrecognized.shtml"</pre>and by creating the
      .shtml pages with a static message concerning the particular error. The
      main advantage of this approach is the web administrator may not know
      PHP. The disadvantage is the necessity of creating many pages but using
      SSI includes the pages could look only like:<pre class="screen">&lt;!--#include file="err_top.shtml"--&gt;
The username you entered has already been used. Please try another username.
&lt;!--#include file="err_bottom.shtml"--&gt;</pre></p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e197"></a>Module common behaviour</h2></div></div><p>Only readers in Active bin will receive Alerts, be allowed to pages
    guarded by Authorization etc.</p><p>In special cases, when you want to stop web access for some reader
    (authorization) but don't want to stop him or her receiving Alerts,
    you must create a dummy authorization group and assign this group to him
    or her.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e204"></a>Module specific behaviour</h2></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e207"></a>Alerts specific behaviour</h3></div></div><p>The Alerts module appears like other regular modules in the slice
      select box. It offers these pages:</p><div class="table"><p><b>Table 2. Alerts menu</b></p><table summary="Alerts menu" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>Alerts Admin - Design</td><td>Email design, choose which filters you want to show and
              their order. You can send an example email to see exactly what
              readers receive.</td></tr><tr><td>Alerts Admin - Settings</td><td>Core settings for the Collection</td></tr><tr><td>Alerts Admin - Emails</td><td>Allows to edit all emails.</td></tr><tr><td>Slice Synchro</td><td>Sets the Reader Management Slice which feeds this Alerts
              Collection. Allows to add or delete the Alerts-specific fields
              to the slice.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The fields added by Slice Synchro are:</p><div class="table"><p><b>Table 3. Alerts specific fields</b></p><table summary="Alerts specific fields" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>how often</td><td>How often the reader receives a digest: instant (each new
              item in one e-mail), daily, weekly, monthly.</td></tr><tr><td>choose filters</td><td>Multiple checkboxes allowing to choose which filters from
              the collection the reader wants to read.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>You may show <span class="emphasis"><em>how often</em></span> or
      <span class="emphasis"><em>choose filters </em></span>in the anonymous forms or you may
      set defaults by hidden fields.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e262"></a><a name="auth"></a>Auth specific behaviour</h3></div></div><p>The Auth administration includes creating groups (Membership
      Types) and assigning disk folders to them. This may be achieved with the
      usage of AA constants, where the constant name is the membership type
      and the constant value are the subgroups assigned to individual folders,
      joined by semicolon.</p><p>For example, if you want to create Standard Membership and
      Privileged Membership, where the first is permitted to folders
      "main" and "search" and the second to "main",
      "search" and "privileged", you create these two
      constants:</p><div class="table"><p><b>Table 4. Membership Constants Example</b></p><table summary="Membership Constants Example" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><span class="emphasis"><em>Name</em></span></td><td><span class="emphasis"><em>Value</em></span></td></tr><tr><td>Standard Membership</td><td>main;search</td></tr><tr><td>Privileged Membership</td><td>main;search;privileged</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The StoreItem function must be edited to call some synchronization
      function, which exports user / group assignments into tables auth_user
      and auth_group, which are used by the MySQL_Auth Apache module.</p><p>To avoid the conflict when two slices use the same subgroup names,
      a postfix (preceded by "_") will be added to each subgroup
      during the export. This is a new setting in Admin - Slice Settings, the
      field &#8220;Auth Postfix&#8221;.</p><p>The second new field in Slice Settings is &#8220;Auth Group&#8221;
      with the name of the field containing the membership type. If this field
      is filled, the slice is synchronized with the auth_user/group tables.</p><p>Both these fields are offered only for Reader Management slices
      created from the Reader Management Minimal template.</p><p>You may set to which bin new users are put on subscription with
      the standard "Allow anonymous posting of items" setting.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e308"></a>Mailman specific behaviour</h3></div></div><p>The Mailman functionality includes some script run regularly by
      cron, which copies info from the AA databse to some text file which in
      turn is read by mailman and used to synchronize its database.</p><p>A multi-checkbox for selecting to which mail lists a user is
      subscribed may be created by standard constants. The name and values of
      the constants are the names of the mail lists. A new Slice Setting is
      shown in Reader Management slices, named &#8220;Mailman Lists&#8221;,
      with the name of the field containing the list names. </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e318"></a>Discussion - Why to use slice?</h2></div></div><p>The main reason to use slice was that we need some reader management
    with the possibility to add any new fields. This is exactly what slice
    does. Also, we can use many other nice features already developed for
    slice. And last but not least if we need to improve the current slice
    interface to better support Reader management, this will be useful for all
    other slices as well. This is for example the case of Anonymous forms.</p></div></div></body></html>
