I don't want to use
    the term &#8220;users&#8221; because of possible confusion with the AA
    users like Authors and more.</p><p>Several modules may be connected with readers:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Alerts, for sending new items by email</li><li>Authorization (Auth), for HTTP authorization via MySQL_Auth</li><li>Mailman, for e-mail discussions</li><li><p>AA permissions synchronization, which propagates username and
        password changes to the AA permission system</p></li></ul></div><p>Readers are identified by email in Alerts and Mailman and by
    username in Auth.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e67"></a>Central point: Slice</h2></div></div><p>After a lot of discussing and unhappily also a lot of work to be
    thrown off, we have in Econnect decided the best approach to handle Reader
    management will be a slice. It is so simple: each item belongs to one
    person. The individual settings for Alerts, Auth etc. are added as fields
    to the item design.</p><p>Note this means not one slice but several slices, one for each web
    site which uses Alerts, Auth or Mailman. Readers of different web sites
    are in different slices and thus independent. Slice features like item
    feeding may be used when necessary.</p><p>The minimal slice template named Reader Management Minimal is now a
    part of the sql_update script and consists of:</p><div class="table"><p><b>Table 1. Fields in the Reader Management Minimal template</b></p><table summary="Fields in the Reader Management Minimal template" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>Username</td><td>Used in the Authorization (Auth) module</td></tr><tr><td>Email</td><td>Required for Alerts and Mailman modules. For each Reader
            Management slice either username or email should be flagged as
            required.</td></tr><tr><td>Password</td><td>If the web uses Auth, this is the HTTP password. Otherwise
            this password must be filled in the anonymous form every time a
            reader wants to change his or her personal details.</td></tr><tr><td>First / Last name</td><td>Not required, may be used to personalize emails.</td></tr><tr><td>Email Confirmed</td><td>This box is automatically checked after the reader clicks
            on a link including the Access Code (see below). No reader
            receives any Alert email until it is checked.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="access_code"></a>Access Code</td><td>This code is received in emails as a part of a URL. By
            clicking on this URL a reader confirms his or her email address.
            The URL points to reader personal details. On webs not using Auth
            this is the only way to edit personal details.</td></tr><tr><td>Remark</td><td>Any remark, may or may not be a part of the personal
            details shown to readers.</td></tr><tr><td>Start date</td><td>Membership start, readers are disabled before this point
            for all related modules.</td></tr><tr><td>Expiry date</td><td>Membership finish, readers are disabled after this point.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Slice administrators create new slice based on this template and may
    add any number of further fields, which is the main advantage of using a
    slice for Reader Management.</p><p>The Alerts module adds automatically its own fields, with special
    field IDs linking to the module, e.g. <tt>alerts1....4e4c7</tt>
    for &#8220;how often&#8221; and Alerts Collection with ID
    <tt>4e4c7</tt>.</p><p>One Reader management slice may be connected with several modules,
    usually belonging to the same web site. Suppose you create a site with
    HTTP restricted access. You may provide an Authorization module and two
    different Alerts Collections. They all link to the same reader group and
    thus use the same Reader management slice.</p><p>In the simplest cases, there will be one Reader management slice +
    one Alerts or Auth module. The Alerts or Auth module will always use
    (almost) directly the slice data.</p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e144"></a>Editing Reader Info: Anonymous posting form</h2></div></div><p>As readers do not have access to the AA control panel, they must

        by the <tt>mod_auth_mysql</tt> Apache module. You must
        install this module on your web server to appreciate the Auth feature.
        There are several versions of the module with different option names.
        Find the correct ones in your version. This is the info you will need:</p><div class="table"><p><b>Table 5. Tables maintained by the Auth feature</b></p><table summary="Tables maintained by the Auth feature" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>auth_user</td><td>with the fields &#8220;username&#8221; and

        <tt>.htaccess</tt> files in folders which you want to

        (meta-groups) and assigning (sub)groups to them. This may be achieved
        with the usage of AA constants, where the constant name is the
        membership type and the constant value are the subgroups assigned to
        individual folders, separated by semicolon.</p><p>For example, if you want to create Standard Membership and
        Privileged Membership, where the first is permitted to folders
        "main" and "search" and the second to "main",
        "search" and "privileged", you create these two
        constants:</p><div class="table"><p><b>Table 6.

        tables <tt>auth_user</tt> and <tt>auth_group</tt>
        using event handlers for events like updating an item or moving the
        item into another bin. Also you should check &#8220;Propagate changes
        into current items&#8221; in the constant group because then if you
        change the subgroups, all user-group assignments for that metagroup
        are updated even in the <tt>auth_group</tt> table.</p><p>To avoid the conflict of another Reader Management slice using
        the same subgroup names, I recommend to use some pre- or postfix (like
        &#8220;myreaders_&#8221; in my example).</p><p>The Auth feature is set on and off using a new item in Slice
        Settings, named &#8220;Auth Group Field&#8221;, with the name of the
        field containing the membership type. This is visible only in Reader
        Management slices created from the Reader Management Minimal template.</p><p>Only when &#8220;Auth Group Field&#8221; is filled, the slice
        is synchronized with the auth_user/group tables.</p><p>You may set to which bin new readers are put on subscription
        with the standard "Allow anonymous posting of items" setting.</p><p>Because readers are assigned to items, they may appear in
        Pending or Expired bin depending on Start date and Expiry date
        settings. You should run the script <tt>auth_maintain.php3?maintain_auth=1</tt>
        once a day by cron to automatically add or delete users moved to or
        from the Active bin.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e651"></a>Mailman specific behaviour</h3></div></div><p>The Mailman functionality includes some script run regularly by

      turn is read by mailman and used to synchronize its database.</p><p>A multi-checkbox for selecting to which mail lists a user is
      subscribed may be created by standard constants. The name and values of
      the constants are the names of the mail lists. A new Slice Setting is
      shown in Reader Management slices, named &#8220;Mailman Lists&#8221;,
      with the name of the field containing the list names.</p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e661"></a>Discussion - Why to use slice?</h2></div></div><p>The main reason to use slice was that we need some reader management
    with the possibility to add any new fields. This is exactly what slice
    does. Also, we can use many other nice features already developed for
    slice. And last but not least if we need to improve the current slice
    interface to better support Reader management, this will be useful for all
    other slices as well. This is for example the case of Anonymous forms.</p></div></div></body></html>
