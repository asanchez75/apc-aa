<H3><A name=cust_lang_how></A>How it works</H3>
<P>Action Applications were designed with internationalization in mind. There 
are currently languages shipping for English, Czech, Slovak, German, and Spanish.
<P>The language configuration is done with statements in the file 
<CODE>config.php3</CODE> which point to other files which contain language 
information. 
<P>Each language has an abbreviation used in the Action Application 
configuration. The abbreviation for English is <EM>em</EM>, Czech is 
<EM>cz</EM>. 
<P>The language information is split up in parts: 
<UL>
  <LI>Common language information in the file 
  <CODE>include/??_common_lang.php3</CODE>. This is used for non application 
  specific language information, for example, for the login box. 
  <LI>Application specific language information. Each Action Application has its 
  own specific language information in the files 
  <CODE>include/??_*_lang.php3</CODE> where * is replaced with an Application 
  dependent abbreviation; for example, the <EM>News Listing</EM> Action 
  Application's language information lives in the file 
  <CODE>include/??_news_lang.php3</CODE>. </LI></UL>Of course the file names do 
not contain question marks; instead, the <EM>??</EM> is replaced by the actual 
language abbreviation. For example, the Czech common language file is named 
<CODE>include/cz_common_lang.php3</CODE>. 
<P>In <CODE>include/config.php3</CODE>, the <EM>common</EM> language files are 
referenced by a <EM>require</EM> statement. The section containing it looks like 
this: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
  <HR>
<PRE># Language: uncomment one language file
require ($GLOBALS[AA_INC_PATH] . "en_common_lang.php3");  # English
</PRE>
  <HR>
  </CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>Exactly one common language file must be uncommented here. 
(Again, the <EM>#</EM> character at the beginning of the line makes it a 
comment.) This means that for the common part, one installation of the Action 
Applications (using one config.php3 file) can only use one language for the 
common parts.
