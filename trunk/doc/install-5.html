<hr>
<P><em>Updated by Jakub Adamek, Econnect, January 2003.</em>
<P>Action Applications were designed with internationalization in mind. There 
    are currently languages shipping for Czech, English, German, Romanian, Slovak, 
    Spanish and partly Japanian.
<P>Each language has an abbreviation used in the Action Application configuration. 
    The abbreviation are <em>cz, en, ge, ro, sk, es</em> and <em>ja</em>. Several 
    constants related to encodings and other are defined in include/constants.php3.
<P>The translations are split up into several parts. Since January 2003, the new 
    module mini-gettext is used. See the scripts in include/mgettext.php3, misc/mgettext 
    and the file <a href="../include/lang/readme.html">include/lang/readme.html</a> 
    about mini-gettext.
<P>There is a variable in the file <CODE>config.php3</CODE> which sets the default 
    language for your installationpoint to other files which contain language 
    information:<CODE> </CODE>

Exactly one common language file must be uncommented here. (The <EM>#</EM> character 
at the beginning of the line makes it a comment.)
