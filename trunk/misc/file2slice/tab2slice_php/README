file_import

Importing large files to ActionApps.

Files:
1) file_import.html	- The form for uploading
2) file_import.php3	- Is a modified filler.php3. There is a loop that reads 
                          every line of the imported table. (at line 72 or so)
3) slices.conf		- A configuration file for slice and field names in 
                          human readable format.
4) slices_conf.php3	- Function for reading slices.conf

Short instructions:
- Export a tab delimited textfile from your database.
  Field names must be in the first line.
- Prepare slices.conf (Slice name as you like, field names from your table.
  slice_id and field_ids from AA)
- Call file_import.html. Type choosen slicename and insert file.

Ideas:
slices.conf should be generated by AA, could be used for multiple extensions
