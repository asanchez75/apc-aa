command-line utilities:
#>  fields2txt.pl sliceid > datafile
#>  txt2fields.pl sliceid < datafile

txt2fields.pl
 * Replaces fields for a slice, based on a text file
 * Used to build slice rapidly, based on names of fields
 * Configure fields (like the 'edit' button in fields control panel),
   but very quickly. 
 * Not well tested, little help -- it is a 'database-level' tool
   Requires understanding of the 'fields' table.

fields2txt.pl
 * exports field structure to text file, in a format that txt2fields.pl can use

---------------------------------------------
An example datafile is: list_fields.apc_member_survey

In short:
* A datafile is a list of fields.  
* Each new field starts with the word 'field' and then has the field name.  
* Optionally, a field can have modifiers; e.g. 
     choosing the input form to be multiple-checkboxes 
     instead of a simple text field.
* Comments (lines starting with #) and whitespace are ignored

txt2fields.pl will supply useful defaults, which is why both 
Example A and Example B will work:

---------------------------------------------
Example A)

field Location / country of your organization.
field Name of Organization
field Email address

---------------------------------------------
Example B)

field Location / country of your organization.
id location........
required 0

field Name of Organization
id headline........
required 1
alias1 _#HEADLINE
alias2 _#RSS_IT_T
alias2_func f_r:100
