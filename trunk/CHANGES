10/13/06 - fixed bug in new input validation code
(honzam)
10/11/06 - new {icq:<user_id>[:<action>[:<style>]]} expressions, which display
(honzam)   ICQ status of the user.
                user_id - ICQ ID of the user
                action  - add | message
                style   - 0-26 - displayed icon type
                        (see: http://www.icq.com/features/web/indicator.html)
         - new {field:<field_id>:name} expression - displays name of the field
           as defined for inputform
         - {ids:<slices>:<conds>[:<sort>[:<delimiter>]]} modified to be able to
           get ids from more than one slice (slice ids are delimited by dash -)
         - "No Item Message" in Item Manager is unaliased now (= you can use AA
           expressions there)
         - new possibility to set ordering of items in Item Manager on two
           or more columns in profiles
         - fixed bug with automatic feeding (did not work, when item was posted
           posted to holding bin first)
         - fixed problem with two boxes inputform - the order of values now
           persist
         - fixed _#ID_COUNT to display also 0
         - paths to scripts are relative again for the admin interface
         - it is possible to order values also by "level" (of nesting)
           as defined in Constants for the field
         - UI change - added another 4 empty rows for setting of permissions
           to slice for user
         - new validation class
         - optimize/repair scripts was moved to AA -> Optimize
           (aa_optimize.php3) script
         - work on history tracking begins - see AA -> history
08/29/06 - new version of "Modify Content..." window - better and universal
(honzam)   interface, more options, easy to write your own new transformation
           class (see AA_Transformation class)
         - "No Item Message" is unaliased now, for Item Manager
         - fixed problem with wrong url of "related Item Window" and "Parameter
           Wizard"
         - fix: _#ID_COUNT returns string "0" if no item is found (instead
           of empty string)
         - new AA_Condition class for conditions manipulations in searchlib.php3
         - fixed email permissions file to use User and Group constatnts instead
           of translated strings
08/22/06 - fixed security hole for setup.php3
(honzam) - changes all binary fields in database to varbinary, which is needed
           for MySQL >=5.0.17 in sql_update.ph3; new repair routine in test.php3
           which repairs db when you already applied unpatched sql_update.php3
           script to MySQL >=5.0.17 database, so your fields are binary and
           users can't login, do not see constants, ...
         - admin/console.php3 now allows run any php script including calling
           AA functions. Only superadministrators could use it (after they
           uncomment one "exit" line in the code.
         - New possibility to delete more than one slice in one step on slice
           deletion page. You can also delete slices, which are not marked
           as deleted.
         - new possibilty to use Local URL Picker as input type
           Thanks to Omar Martinez / Jaime Torres
         - Superadmin is now able to change posted_by field through
           "Modify content" feature of Admin interface
         - New {expresions}
             - {log:number:base} for logarithm
             - {unpack:pcked_id} for unpacking packed id
         - es language files updated (just 2 additions)
         - fixed bug "When you add a value in a hierarchicalConstant it
           does not respond to the onChange triger on the mainbox"
           Thanks to Omar Martinez
         - fixed feeding bug - the items was rewritten or imported once more
           if they was edited in the source slice
         - fixed small bugs
         - begin the work on aa_synchronize.php3 script, which allows to sync
           setting of two similar AA installs or just slices
07/27/06 - moved from CVS to SVN (Subversion)
(honzam) - "Modify Content" group operation in Item Manager is improved. It uses
           new AA_Transformation API, so new transformation function could be
           easily added. There is new "Translate" transformation, by which you
           are able to transform one value to one or more values. It works also
           with multivalues. It uses new TabWidgetToggle for parameter setting.
         - New possibility to change URL of uploaded files/images (per slice
           basis). Images was stored with general AA URL for all slices, which
           is not always what you want. Now you can redefine it on slice setting
           page. Not 100% finished, yet.
         - Session IDs are propageted via cookies (if possible - if not, URL
           parameter used - just as before)
         - AA_Slices and AA_Views classes used for slice/view properties,
           where possible. Those classes caches slice/view properties, so it
           reduces number of database calls.
         - Started work on AA_Components class used for plugable classes.
         - Started work on TabWidgetToggle - Widget, which allows you to set
           different parameters for different options in the selectbox above.
           Say you want to inport data from CSV or XML - for both formats
           you have to set another parameters, so you first select the CSV
           and the parameters like "delimiter" apears on the screen
         - Started work on AJAX editing - Proof of Concept - you can use it like
             {ajax:{_#ITEM_ID_}:headline........[:_#HOW2SHOW]}
           which means, that _#HOW2SHOW for _#ITEM_ID_ will be printed inside
           the div and after click on it the textfield for headline........
           is displayed and the field could be directly edited. It works
           in AA Item Manager as well as on public page - you just need
           to attach javascript/ajax.js to your page. It is just experimental
           version, yet.
         - Started work on AA_ChangesMonitor class which will track the field
           changes/history - we are still at the beginning, here.
         - New class AA_Fields holding information the field information
         - New AA_Metabase class which will be used to hold all the informations
           about table structure. It will be additional database abstraction
           layer.
         - New AA_Condition class for conds[] handling
         - aainputfield renamed to AA_Inputfield
           (used new naming convention for AA classes).
         - views class renamed and AA_Views. AA_Views was improved to use static
           class variable to cache the view properties which reduces the number
           of database queries. Static class variable also allows us not to use
           global variables for that cache.
         - grabber class renamed to AA_Grabber, saver class to AA_Saver
           and moved to grabber.class.php3 file

--------------------
07/14/06 - v2.10.0 - stable release
--------------------
07/14/06 - new possibility to display HTML comments before and after the view
(honzam)   by checking the checkbox in view setting - good for debug
         - mail template for sending discussion comments to users is grabbed
           from FIRST discussion view of the slice, if the view is not asociated
           in Fulltext setting, for some reason
         - fixed sending of test e-mail to Readers
         - language files updated
         - optimize/reapair framework disabled by default in test.php3
06/30/06 - added object_text, object_float, object_numeric tables
(honzam)   to the databaase used as general object store
06/27/06 - fixed RSS and AARSS feeding - short_ids are not incremented after
(honzam)   each feeding - Feeding moved to grabber/saver API
         - improved usability of Admin interface of View edit - you will stay
           on the view setting after save (not moved to list of views)
         - {rss:...} alias now replaces also "& " by "&amp; "
         - SELECT + INSERT/UPDATE used instead of REPLACE SQL command. REPLACE
           is not implemented in many DB engines and it also do not work
           correctly with autoincremented values in MySQL
         - fixed form validation for multivalue fields
           (it did not work correctly for example for numeric fields)
         - fixed bug in SQL query for mapping fields (query failed on MySQL 5)
06/14/06 - fixed security problem with require - requires no longer use
(honzam)   variables (see http://secunia.com/advisories/20299/)
         - new possibility to use aliases and fields from Reader Slice
           in Alert's e-mails. Now it is possible to create personalized e-mail
           templates, so the e-mail could look like "Dear Mr. Rosicky, ...".
           You can use the aliases in welcome e-mail as well as in alerts e-mail
         - Alerts test page is rewritten, so you can select from list
           of associated Readers and send the e-mail as if it is sent on regular
           basis to that user
         - new AA expressions which is based on f_t alias function modifiers
           Instead of {alias:headline........:f_t:some_text:striptags} you can
           write {striptags:some_text}. The same it is for
               - {rss:some_text}
               - {csv:some_text}
               - {safe:some_text}
               - {javascript:some_text}
               - {urlencode:some_text}
               - {conds:some_text}
           There is also new {substitute:some_text} which simply expands
           the text (finds aliases and substitute) and
           {convert:some_text:from:to} for character encoding
           (like: {convert:some_text:windows-1250:us-acsii})
         - database structure updated to better work in MySQL 4 and MySQL 5
           (columns with packed ids are marked as binary, so it is not converted
           during import by MySQL characterset feature)
         - fixed problem with COMMENTS used on MySQL 3
           (which do not supprt this feature)
         - fixed problem with SQL JOIN command in MySQL 5 in Links module
         - csv import rewritten to allow periodical feeding of the data from
           url/file (not completed yet)
         - added number of displayed items near to page-scroller
         - there is no longer need to add slice_id parameter to itemedit.php3
           script if called from public pages. You can just provide id
           (the slice_id is then grabbed from the item). Internaly we slightly
           modified the character encoding handling in html header of input form.
         - fix: removed additional line breaks in text e-mails
         - fixed windows-1250 to us-ascii conversion (used for example as
           view.php3?vid=123&convertfrom=windows-1250&convertto=us-ascii)
         - changing of headline........ field enabled in
           "Admin" -> "Change field IDs"
         - new AA_Alias/ AA_Aliases class for better Alias handling
           (internal change)
         - FILEMAN_MODE_FILE and FILEMAN_MODE_DIR for file uploads changed from
           variables to constants (which is more safe)
05/25/06 - added new rss option to f_t function
(brazda)
04/24/06 - new parameter convertto and convertfrom for view.php3 which changes
(honzam)   character encoding
           (http://examle.org/aa/view.php3?vid=22&convertfrom=windows-1250&convertto=utf-8)
         - fixed bug in synchronization with Apache auth module -
           tables auth_user and auth_group are not cleaned after Reader
           Management Slice is updated, but they are filled with correct values,
           now
         - new insert type Date (just logically saparates text and date inputs;
           internaly it bahaves just like text field
         - better behavior of File upload field when checked as Required. There
           is no longer need to fill upper field in the inputform. However, it
           is still not perfect since the content is checked before we move
           the file to destination directory, which might sometimes fail
04/19/06 - authors can now see all items in related item window but they
(brazda)   can edit only their own items
04/07/06 - added priority field for slices (modules), so you can reorder
(honzam)   the modules in top-right selectbox
         - top-right slice/module selecbox is now generated as external
           javascript file (cached), so the admin pages are loaded more quicker
         - new {now} alias (returns current time as timestamp, so you can use
           it in compare functions)
         - new "clear pagecache" option in test.php3
         - fixed problem with fileuploads - new directory for slice is created
           with the right permissions, again
         - fixed bug in offline filling - the HTML falg was not accepted
         - fixed bug in the unaliasing of parameters of field input functions
03/27/06 - Updated database structure (sql_update.php3)
03/21/06 - Added support for unaliasing of parameters of field input
(brazda)   functions. Now you can use any {} AA expressions in parameters
           (e.g. conds[0][switch..........]={user:switch..........} in
           combination with user settings from ReaderManagement module).
03/16/06 - small improvement of sitemodule UI - standard widgets used, where
(honzam)   possible
03/15/06 - new {ifset:<aa_expression>:<aa_output>}
(honzam)   If <aa_expression> is filled by some text, then print <aa_output>.
           <aa_output> could contain _#1 alias as shortcut for <aa_expression>
           condition, but you can use any {} AA expression. Example:
              {ifset:{img_height.....2}: height="_#1"}
         - There are new links to View-edit page under each textarea, which
           contain {view.php3?vid=...} so you can easily navigate between view
           settings
         - Fixed some language constants
03/02/06 - new {ids:<slice>:<conds>[:<sort>[:<delimiter>]]} syntax, which
(honzam)   returns long item ids based on on conditions  d-... (like in views)
           Example:
              {ids:6a435236626262738348478463536272:d-category.......1-RLIKE-Bio-switch.........1-=-1:headine........-}
           returns dash separated long ids of items in selected slice where
           category begins with Bio and switch is (=) 1 ordered by headline
           descending. The main usage is with {item..} syntax - just like:
               {item:{ids:...}:_#HEADLINE}
         - new Conditions and Sortorder classes (used for conditions...)
02/28/06 - New test environment. Created new abstract class Optimize (test.php3),
(honzam)   from which you (as programmer) can create new testing and possibly
           repair scripts. For now we have two tests/repairs
             - finding unnecessary duplicate records in relation table
             - conversion of permissions for items, which was filled by some
               reader from Reader slice.
           Run /test.php3 for more details.
         - HTMLArea generates shorter <p> tags (instead of javascript nonsence)
         - Fixed deletion of temporary uploaded files
         - SQL query optimalization in perm_core.php3
         - Fixed bug with Links module - in some specific cases the link was
           not updated
         - Fixed caching problem - the cache is not invalidated as whole after
           site update
02/19/06 - Discussions updated
(honzam)     - author/email/url is stored in cookies, so readers do not need to
               fill it twice. No new setting of discussion is needed -it works
               as is.
             - Authors of the article as well as authors of the comment could
               be notified about new posted comment by email
               see: http://actionapps.org/en/Interacting_With_Your_Audience#Tip_2:_New_comment_notification
         - {item:<ids>:<aa_expression>[:<delimiter>]} code now allows to specify
           more than one ID in <ids>. <ids> should be dash "-" separated
           and could be in short as well as long form. You can specify also
           record delimiter as fourth parameter. If not present no delimiter is
           used. Example: {item:53443-54322-53553:_HEADLINE:, }
         - "Modify content" function of AA admin interface improved:
              - now is able to set/unset also HTML/text flag
              - now also able to copy content of another field
                (exactly as is - including multivalues!)
         - You can display all informations about specified item
           on "AA -> AA Finder" page, now
         - CSV import improved
             - fixed problem with tabelator as delimiter,
             - code converted to standard Files::upload functions
         - Slice name with link is now displayed on "Admin -> RSS Feeds" page
         - Fixed PHP5 related bugs
             - New configuration variables DB_CHARACTER_SET and
               DB_COLLATION_CONNECTION which is needed by MySQL 4.1 and PHP5
               when you do not want to comunicate with database in UTF
             - Offline filing now do not crash on WDDX_unserialize (php5 bug).
             - "30 Nov 1999" date bug
         - The data for offline filling could be submited not only in offline
           parameter, but you can send it also as uploaded file
           (in offline.php3)
         - Fixed problem with uploads to the "Slice Setting Fields"
         - Fixed some problems with setting permissions to users from Reader
           Management slice (bugs introduced by changing identification of users
           from login name to item_id some time ago (08/30/05))
         - Fixed site/slice caching
             - now invalidated after spot move...
             - the cache is not cleared completely after slice setting change,
               but only for current slice (and all related views and sites,honza
               of course)
             - view cache now count with all set[] parameters, so the view is
               generated well even if you use set[] command for nested view
               (just like in view.php3?vid=1781&set[997]=selected-759644)
         - Fixed e-mail notify setting page - no wrong slashes added to the text
         - Fixed bug in cross server feeding, which causes relation table
           is filled with the rows where both values are the same
         - New internal API for views which allows to cache views definition
           within one php script call
02/14/06 - fixed a bug in MLXGetText - setlang should be used to set the lang
(mimo)     forcefully
         - &errcheck=1 now works for MLXGetText
02/10/06 - fixed a bug in mlx.php which messed up sharing one MLX Control Slice
(mimo)     between multiple content slice
#
#        (incomplete)
         - hardcoded table for fulltext of discussion do not have width=100%
           now, because it makes troubles in IE on pages with CSS layout
12/30/05 - computed fields can compute also with self content as well as with
(honzam)   content of others computed fields, now
12/23/05 - fixed security problem, when readers was able to read slice_pwd
(honzam)
12/21/05 - HTMLarea/Xinha updated to work with Firefox 1.5 and some small
(brazda)   changes in the plugins (InsertFile)
12/16/05 - now also Reader Management modules are shown in Input type selecbox
(brazda)   on Field settings page
12/15/05 - user data (like password, name, e-mail) is now editable by users
(honzam)   itself (just click on your login name in upper right corner
           of the page - near the "Logout")
         - new {@fieldlist} syntax construct, which lists all field names
           in the item. The syntax is exactly the same as you already know from
           {@category.......1} syntax, so you can use also:
              {@fieldlist:-},
              {@fieldlist:,:<b>_#1</b>}
              as well as {@fieldlist(_#CSV_FMTD):,:_#1}.
           For more info see {@category.......1} or {list:category.......1}
           syntax in the manual.
           Could be used for example to create general CSV export from the slice
              Odd HTML is: {@fieldlist(_#CSV_FMTD):,:_#1}, where
              _#CSV_FMTD is defined as f_t and with parameter:
                  {alias:{loop............}:f_t::csv}.
         - new operators added to searchbar (in ItemManager):
             "not set" (= ISNULL),
             "is set" (= NOTNULL)
           so you can search for items, where specified field is (not) set
         - changed behavior of unary operators ISNULL and NOTNULL - Those
           operators did not work without "value" specified, which was quite
           strange, for unary operators. Now it works without any value
           specified.
         - top HTML for discussions now can contain aliases (and other
           constructs), just like for any other view
         - new configuration option TOEXECUTE_ALLOWED_TIME which defines, how
           long should be processed tasks from "toexecute" queue
         - added better support for bulgarian language translation
         - log class prepared for the possibility to turn off logging
           of specifis events (UI needed)
         - searchform in ItemManager and LinksManager uses GET mathod,
           which is more user friendly
         - discussions code a bit cleaned
         - fixed problem with session on for some special Apache configuration,
           when some server variables are not filled (Bluelink case)
         - fixed all_ids parameter in discussions - now works also for GET,
           not only for POST forms
         - fixed problem with "break;" outside of the loop (APC PHP cache had
           problems with this)
11/24/05 - anonymous wizard refactored a bit, generate better code and is
(honzam)   functional, now (thanks goes to Norbert Brazda for bugfixing)
         - Spanish language translation updated (thanks to Julian Casasbuenas
           from Colnodo)
         - new possibility to remove selected items from database (see "Remove
           (remove from database)" bottom action on Item Manager - Trash page)
         - fixed language constants
11/21/05 - fixed typo in sql_update.php3 - Thanks to Omar Martinez and Misi Bako
11/15/05 - fixed not functional image upload, when we want upload multiple
(honzam)   images and create multiple thumbnails in one inputform
10/01/05 - CSV import is allowed also for editors (see left menu in ItemManager)
(honzam)   and small fixes in CSV imports
         - confirmation of spot delete is now required (in site module)
         - limit group name length in bulk constatnt import to 16 characters
           (which is the only correct value)
         - fix for computed field - the value is updated corectly, if you are
           editing the item, now
         - fixed category tree display (Links module) in Firefox, which did not
           work correctly for huge category trees
         - improved site manager - looks better in IE (but not perfect, yet)
09/27/05 - fixed bug in constant edit (pack_id() error)
(honzam)
09/22/05 - you are able to specify the name for all tabs, when you are using
(honzam)   inputform formbreaks:
              {formbreak:<current_tab_name>:<next_tab_name>:...}
           The names are separated by ":" and are applied to current and then
           other tabs. It is useful mainly for the last tab.
         - new function {preg_match:[0-9]*:some text with number 25452 in it},
           which returns 25452 (based on specified regular expression)
09/21/05 - removed not closed html table tag from images.php in ImageManager
(brazda)
09/14/05 - fix to allow admins to assign slice permissions also to users from
(brazda)   Reader Management slice(s)
09/01/05 - addes action icons to spot actions in site manager
(honzam) - fixed constant editing - the category groups with accents and similar
           strange characters works correctly, now
08/31/05 - fix of no item message - works correctly if you fill 0 in it (zero)
(honzam) - default inputform view for the slice now could be set not only
           from default Profile setting page, but also
           from "Slice Admin" -> "Design - Item Manager" -> "Use special view",
           which is easier to find for users. Both options are equal (stores it
           to the profile)
         - added more description text to discussion view selectbox on
           "Design - Fulltext" page
08/30/05 - new function {compare:<number1>:<number2>} for comparing numbers
(honzam)   (aka dates): Returns:    'L' if number1 is less than number2,
                                    'G' if number1 is greater than number2,
                                    'E' if the numbers are equal.
           Usage example:
            {switch({compare:{last_edit.......}:1125481998})L:less:G:more:equal}
         - user_id for users authenticated from Reader slice is changed
           from login to more logical and more powerfull item_id
         - fixes in Reader Management permissions combination with SQL
           (perm_sql) permissions
         - some cleanup of the permissions core
08/29/05 - Readers from Reader Management slice could became AA users (now also
(honzam)   on SQL permissions perm_sql.php3 - for LDAP permissions it worked
           from 02/16/04)
           Database structure for SQL permissions is slightly modified in order
           we can store Reader Slice permissions as well. You can run
           sql_update.php3 script or you just change definition of two columns
           in the database:
               membership.memberid change from INT(11) to CHAR(32)
               perms.userid        change from INT(11) to CHAR(32)
08/26/05 - uploaded images can now be resized also exactly to specified
(brazda)   size (e.g. square). Image is resized and croped if needed from
           the center of original image. It can be set-up in parameters of
           "Insert" function for the field on "Slice Admin" -> "Fields" page.
08/26/05 - new possibility to create "Computed field". It is good solution for
(honzam)   all values, which could be precomputed, since its evaluation
           on item-show-time would be slow. Any of your field could be changed
           to "computed" - you just change "Insert" function for the field
           on "Slice Admin" -> "Fields" page. In such case the other setting
           of the field (like Default, Input type, ...) are irrelevant,
           of course. Two prepared field templates (computed_num....
           and computed_txt....) was added to sql_update.php3. Yes, you can use
           any {view...}, {include...}, {switch...} in the computed string
           (in Parameter)
         - fixed /misc/charset/convert.php3 script (which is able to convert any
           text from one encoding to another one) - now works when called
           externaly
08/18/05 - improved CSV import of data. Now you can not only
(honzam)       - "Store the item with new id"
               - "Do not store the item" or
               - "Update the item (overwrite)"
           with already existing items, but you can also select
               - "Rewrite only the fields, for which the action is defined"
               - "Add the values in paralel to current values (the multivalues
                  are stored, where possible)"
         - view parameters now could be combined. You can use
             cmd[65][]=v-66&cmd[65][]=c-1-Cars
           or if you want to display only items from the set which passes the
           condition, you can write
             cmd[65][]=x-82763-82344-82352&cmd[65][]=c-1-Cars
         - new possibility to upload constants from admin interface - see
           "Import constants" on constants editing page
         - fixing moveLeft and moveRight in sitemodule administration
         - added new field types based on suggestion of Philip King and Antonin
           Slejska:
           (name, phone, fax, address, location, city, country, range, real)
         - some cleanup
08/01/05 - fixed bug in site display (honzam)
07/26/05 - new site module admin interface design (thanks to Colnodo)
(honzam) - year selectbox always show the year of the filled date
           (so the previously filled years are never lost)
         - all selectboxes should always show the filled value, even if
           the value in not in the list
         - fixed return url from Slice Field Setting page
         - fixed feeding mapping setting - the special option (like "--Value--")
           is shown again
         - fixed alerts sending problem - it did not work for some slices
           (the one with backslash in packed_id, for instance)
         - fixed problem with Edit used/Add user, the right user is displayed
           after update
         - fixed searchbar - the operator in the condition is not lost
         - fixed field default function - qte is no longer used, since it is
           the same as txt
         - fixed link to AA general documentation in doc/index.html
         - fixed quoting problem in feeding (\") appears for some feeds data
06/28/05 - new dynamic "slice setting fields" implemented - now you have
(honzam)   the possibility to add "slice fields" (just like you do with normal
           item fields). Such fields then can be used for slice setting common
           to all items. Such fields are prefixed by underscore (automaticaly)
           and you can access it through {alias:_field_id.......:f_e:slice_info}
06/27/05 - fixed problem with sql_update.php3 - creating toexecute table syntax
(honzam)   error. The download files on sourceforge are updated.

           is BIG (=can't be loaded into memory)
         - the id of the site module is marked automaticaly as cached (no need
           to add it to $slices4cache array manualy in site control file)
06/16/05 - fixed multilingual MLX extension - now works again
(honzam+mimo)
06/15/05 - pagecache now takes care about cookies as well - the page is not

         - fixed caching of discussions in site module
         - fixed normal slice feeding of items (added missing feeding include)
05/03/05 - aliases setting converted to standard Frm* functions, which BTW

         - itemview class prepared for row_delimiter parameter which will allow
           to print code between items in view
         - fixed include paths to be absolute and not relative. Relative paths
           in require_once makes some problem on AA install on WinXP.
           Thanks belongs to Omar Martinez @ Colnodo
         - fixed link to javascript triggers documentation (FAQ)
         - fixed link to group setting (from permissions setting page)
         - fixed QueryZids()'s "ALL" parameter for searching all bins

           from slice table - was unused for a long time
         - fix - Anonymous Form Wizard result is in correct encoding, now
         - speed optimalizations and small fixes like typos delimeter->delimiter
04/25/05 - new possibility of ceating exact copy of the remote slice through
(honzam)   AARSS (XML exchange) (only short_id is changed)
         - ItemContent class used for grabbing data from form - newer
           Object Oriented approach applied
         - "Anonymous Form Wizard" and "Inter Node Import setting" optimized -
           converted to standard inputs
         - a bit more beauty code - some coding standards setting applied
         - new set[]=group_limit parameter, so it is usable also for views
         - file upload functions cleaned and generalized
         - fix - sort all listings by publish_date in case no sort is specified
04/20/05 - change value of constant with "propagation to items" is much quicker
(honzam)   on Slice Admin -> Fileds - Edit -> Constants - Edit, now
           constant value could be 255 characters long (instead of 149)
           (you do not need to update database tables for this change)
         - fixed bug - content of the view was wrong modified by slices[] url
           parameter. Now it is not modified by slices[] parameter.
           You can still use set[23]=slices-6556666355368859... parameter

04/15/05 - new possibility to Enable/Disable specified spots in the site module
(honzam)   interface
         - small bugfixes in site module code; code cleaned
04/11/05 - new possibility to specify "group limit". Group limit is used
(honzam)   for limiting number of items from one category. If you want to list
           items grouped by category.......1, but you want to see just first
           three items from each category, then you could use "group limit".
           You can specify it as:
             3category.......1-
             (limit to three items from category.......1 - descending)
             for "order" slice.php3 parameter, or "sort" view.php3 parameter.
           Another usage is:
             sort[0][category.......1]=d&sort[0][limit]=3
             for slice.php3
           (it is also good in case you want to list all categories header,
           in which is at least one item - you can just set limit to 1)
         - conditions (conds[]) now could contain also long (unpacked) ids
           for id item field
         - new possibility to define, how the Related Selection Window listing
           should look - define view for it
         - the records with the same key and value is not listed twice
           in the inputform selectboxes
         - fixed dicussion caching - the cache is now invalidated correctly
           after user sendinds the post to the discussion
         - fixed slice.php3 content caching - it was broken since we added
           _#SESSION_ alias, which was different each time the slice.php3
           was called. Now it is done better way (f_e:session) function
         - searchbar now uses better help texts for date fields (the help text
           is in "value" field, not in "operator" field)
         - fixed counting of links in categories (Links module)
         - new possibility to generete standard gettext .PO language files
         - used longer database types for some fields (sql_update.php3)
           (like fulltext_format of slice, view - 2^16 is not enough for some
           aplications)
         - removed all mysql specific functions from perm_sql.php3 (it was last
           place in AA, where we did not use database abstract layer)
         - fixed author/editor security problem in Related Selection Window
           (thanks to Norbert Brazda)
         - category_sort field is now filled by 0 and converted to group_by
           field, when compact view is edited (for very old AA slices). This
           field is there only for backward compatibility - now we use better
           approach (at least three years) - group_by
         - corrected some database queries for easier migration to other
           database engines
         - hierarchical constants are now better handled in inputform - we use
           alias for javascript, which defines the constants, so it is possible
           to change the look of the form without specifying the constants there
         - small speed optimalizations (split() -> explode())
         - imagecopyresampled used instead of imagecopyresized - better image
           (thumbnail) quality generated (based on Norbert Brazda suggestion)
         - new cacheDb(), cacheMemDb(), cacheMem() functions, which joins
           pagecache and contentcache together
         - speed optimalization, set bigger time limit for dictionary aliases
         - improved toexecute class - time measurement implemented so we can run
           as many tasks within given time as possible
             - it allows execute many small tasks or only one big one
         - RSS feeds is able to decode diferent character encoding
           (thanks to Norbert Brazda)
         - better logging of alerts
         - fixed typo in category description cat-description field

         - fixed sql_update.php3 for MySQL 4.1
         - LDAP configuration updated (again)
02/20/05 - Added MLX mini view to display list of alternative translations for
(mimo)     an article
           {mlx_view:view format in html} mini view of translations available
                                          for this article does substitutions
                                          %lang, %itemid
           e.g. {mlx_view:<a href='?x-_#SITEMID_-&mlx=%lang'>%lang</a>}
         - Fixed a problem in MLXGetText I had already fixed in 1.15
         - Finalised reverse relation thing below
02/18/05 - fixed a bug with mutual/reverse related items:
(mimo)     when adding a new reverse relation it used to keep an empty
           text content, so one reverse relation were 2 entries in the
           target content. The fix deletes '' text relations from the target
           content.
         - minor mlx fixes
02/11/05 - other LDAP fixes for its new version - updated documentation
(honzam)  and configuration (thanks to Jiri Reischig)
         - e-mail is now marked as "required" on setup screen

         - fixed e-mail validation functions to accept also domains like .museum
         - new modificator for f_t alias function - conds - allows you to call
           view with conds, just like:
              {view.php3?vid=9&cmd[9]=c-1-{alias::f_t:{_#VALUE___}:conds}}
         - better pagecache handling in site module (small fix)
02/03/05 - added 'integer' field type so searches and sorting can be done
(mimo)     numerically
01/29/05 - new {str_replace:search:replace:subject} aliase construct
(honzam) - {dictionary} now creates also links for all the words with first
           letter in uppercase
         - added new value for nocache slice.php3 and view.php3 url parameter -
           nocache=invalidate. It not only create the page without cache,
           it also clear the cache for all views used in generation of the page
         - new fix=1 parameter for alerts.php3 - if set, then send only e-mail
           to not processed collections
         - AA generates as short url as possible
           (sometimes only parameters "?x=17232" - see f_b, f_f)
         - parameters for user alias functions f_u are expanded before call user
           functions
         - fixed some help texts for Parameter Wizard

(mimo)     macro
         - added MLX_OPTIMIZE, if >5 it should speed up MLX results
01/13/05 - words for {dictionary} feature are not replaced, if it is just
(honzam)   substrings of another (bigger) words (thanks to Hana Havelkova)
         - added favicon for AA (thanks to Sarka Vasku)
         - new aliases for slice.php3:
             _#SESSION_ - session id
             _#PAGE_NO_ - number of current page (on pagescroller)
             _#PAGE_LEN - page length (number of items)
         - added loging to alerts sending (how many mails sent, begin and end)
         - fixed HTMLArea for en-utf8 (english UTF8) language
         - fixed typo in sql_update.php3
01/06/05 - discussions are not cached now, so there will not be problem
(honzam)   with unupdated list of comments
         - pagecache fixes
         - fixed bug in "links" module - category crossreferencing works also
           for catalogs, where you can crossreference deeper category
           ("select start") than is your "tree start"
01/04/05 - new implementation of pagecache - uses two tables - pagecache
(honzam)   (as the old one) and pagecache_str2find table. It should bring much
           quicker pagecache invalidation, when the content must be updated.
           Database update (sql_update.php3) for new table is needed.
         - fixed bug in Related Item Window input type - related items from
           trash are displayed correctly, now
12/30/04 - new "Toexecute" class used for e-mail sending - e-mails are not send
(honzam)   in one run of the script. It is rather send from AA cron, so the load
           of the server is lowered
         - slice name displayed on itemedit form
         - new possibility to change date for discussion comment from AA admin
         - e-mail's "From:" address is required, now
         - the "Errors-to:" header form generated e-mails is supplied
         - fixed bug with anonymous form creation (thanks to Omar Martinez)
         - fixed typo in view edit form
         - fixed pagecache bug
12/24/04 - {dictionary...} formating construct now do not search in SCRIPT,
(honzam)   H1-6, A tags as well as  inside tags itself
12/16/04 - new Input type: Multiple Text Field - allows to enter more than one
(honzam)   (multiple) values into one field (just like when you select multiple
           values from Multiple Selectbox). The new values are filled in popup
         - new edit possibility for related items from itemedit
         - fixed adding item to related slice
12/14/04 - new possibility to open inputform to popup window and fill item
(honzam)   to another slice during filling in another item in the current slice
           (used in Related Item Window - enable it by 'show actions' parameter
           of "Related Item Window" input type)
         - prepared for improved pagecache implementation; generalized API
         - code improvements - used OOP more (slice object, zids)
                             - reduced ussage of global variables
         - small javascript files reorganization
         - discussion buttons texts are unaliased now (you can use aliases, ...
           there
11/26/04 - think I fixed the _#ITEMINDX problem, that subviews would make
(mimo)	   it invalid for parent views - now using a stack
           (see item.php3 and itemview.php3)
         - disabled the caching in MLX postqueryzids,see comments in MLX for why
         - added a mlx import function, in /misc/mlx/import.php
11/23/04 - any AA format-string could be used for displaying selects from
(honzam)   related slice (not only 1 field like headline........). You can place
           the format-string in "slice field" parameter for the Input Type.
           It works for all Input Types allowing displaying selections from
           a slice, like Selectbox, Two windows, Multiple Selectboxes,
           Radiobuttons, Multiple checkboxes...
         - new dictionary feature
           You can create "dictionary" slice, where each item will contain
           a word (in keywords........ field!) and url in other field (and
           possibly any other fields). Then you can use this "dictionary" slice
           in your own slice to add links to "dictionary words". You can do it
           by alias construct:
             {dictionary:<dictionary_slice_id>:<output_text>:<format>:<conds>}
           where - dictionary_slice_id is id of "dictionary slice"
                 - output_text is the text, where you want to search and replace
                               for dictionary words,
                 - format specifies, how to replace the keyword
                 - conds is optional parameter, where you can filter only subset
                   of used keywords from "dictionary slice". The syntax is
                   normal conds[] array like:
                   conds[0][category........]='myDict'&conds[1]...
                   (simplified as well as extended syntax)
           Example:
             {dictionary:4394e6117a0d66fee7cb49ffab9015d2:{_#FULLTEXT}:
             <a href="_#KEYW_URL">_#KEYWORD_</a>}
           _#KEYWORD_ is special alias, which could not be defined in the
           "dictionary slice". The reason, why we use it is, that you can use
           Multi value field as keyword (in keywords........). It is good
           to have only one dictionary item for one word (like APC) and then
           define multivalue for keyword, where you can fill "APC", "apc",
           "apc.org"... It is important for English, but it is crucial for such
           languages as is Czech with different kinds of words.
           Note: Use this feature mainly for fulltexts of item and not in
                 item-listing, since it is not so quick, at this moment.
11/18/04 - fixed a caching bug in include/view.php3 when using mlx
(mimo)   - fixed duplicated code in include/view.php3

11/18/04 - added "id" and "short_id" definitions to fields table for each slice,
(honzam)   where the definition is missing. It allows searchbar in Item Manager
           to create filter also on Short id field, ...
         - added missing nolinks field to links_categories table in sql_update
         - default empty option for selectboxes is on the top of list
           (not the bottom), now
         - MySQL - fixes for 4.1 (works without problems, now)
            - table columns in queries are enclosed by apostrophs (`column`)
            - trying to simplify queries to MySQL can use indexes better
         - alerts sending script (modules/alerts/alerts.php3) could be called
           also from real - system cron (reads also commandline arguments, now).
           The benefit is, that the script then can run as long as you want -
           it is not stoped be Apache after 2 minutes or whatever is set
           in TimeOut. The commandline could look like:
               # php alert.php3 howoften=weekly
           or with 'nice' and allowing safe_mode (for set_time_limit)
           and skiping to right directory for example:
               # cd /var/www/example.org/apc-aa/modules/alerts && nice php
                 -d safe_mode=Off alerts.php3 howoften=weekly
           The command above could be used from cron.
         - Links module improvements
            - fixed "Change state" for categories - it could by highlighted now
            - fixed "general categories proposal from public"
            - new possibility to restrict category list on output by l_p alias
         - fix of "{user:...} alias"
         - fixed e-mail validation for 4-characters domains (.info)
         - better "end of paragraph" detection for f_a - abstract function
         - better setting of slice.php3 cache - now the cache hit is much more
           probable (clear_url (with session ID!) is not in keystring, now)
11/12/04 - fixed HTMLArea 3.0rc1 support (honzam)
11/11/04 - Two Boxes input type (as well as some others types) now are able to
(honzam)   display not only name of the constant, but any other field from
           constant table (like value, priority, short id, ...).
           You will do it by inserting const_name, const_value, const_pri, ...
           keywords in "slice field" parameter (you will see the parameter
           in the parameter wizard
11/08/04 - Hierarchical Constant Editor could be used more than one on the page
(honzam)
11/06/04 - Link module improved
(honzam)   - new class for link management
           - completely changed handling of general categories (full automatic)
         - new HTMLArea 3.0rc
         - new possibility for cached javascripts (used in links module)
           (dynamicaly generated javascript is stored into database and then
            is included to the HTML file as external javascript file. Advantage
            is, that when the content of js is not changed, yhen the external
            file is not loaded (so it is quicker) - prooved with Apache log
         - prepared new item action - move to different slice (item manager)
11/05/04 - MLXGetText added (based on Honza's {_m:); will post instructions
(mimo)     on http://mimo.gn.apc.org/mlx/
           - {mlx:addslice:slice id:language[:domain[:mode]]} (domain defaults
             to global) use mode=learn to enable adding new items to the slice
             for unknown strings e.g.
             {mlx:addslice:3a0c44958b1c6ad697804cfdbccd8b09:{l}:IWPR Site:learn}
           - {_m:text to translate[:param1:param2:..]}
             {_m:Test %1 and %2 and %3:bla 1:bla 2:bla 3}
             would give 'Test bla1 and bla2 and bla3' in EN
           - {mlx:setdomain:domain} set MLXGetText to use this domain
         - removed my {include:file:filter} nonsense
10/25/04 - New {include:file:file:method1[:method2[:...]]}
(mimo)	   This calls filter methods method1, method2,.. on global object
           $GLOBALS[filter] after reading the file. Very nice with site module.
           Member function is called like this: method1(&$fileout,&$args)
10/20/04 - changes to {include} -- extended support for a very specialised
(mimo)     readfile mode
         - MLX: now using packed id for storing MLX control slice
10/15/04 - view.php3 now with MLX support for fulltext (single item) views
(mimo)     e.g. cmd[11]=x-1280&set[11]=mlx-DE will display the German version of
                the item with shortid 1280 instead of item 1280
10/14/04 - new {include:file:readfile} reads file contents, file is relative to
(mimo)     $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]
10/11/04 - Added script support, mlx.php has its own mappings table which
(mimo)     indicates what kind of DIR to use for controls in the Add/Edit Item
           This gets passed through a global mlxFormControlExtra to formutil
           - changed formutil to include the value of this global
           - added a new utf-8 language file and a language def en-utf8 which
             can be selected in the slice settings
10/06/04 - Added MLX support for views and finetuning slice settings interface
(mimo)     Parameter for view.php3
           - set[vid]=mlx-(lang)-(lang1)-..-(MODE) same as for slice.php3
10/05/04 - Totally reworked MLX, now using packed ids for storing MLX info
(mimo)
10/04/04 - Added Multilingual Extension - dont use yet (mimo)
             - mlx in URL to slice.php3
         - Slice Settings MLX field
         - Additions for MLX look&feel in tem manager
         ... more here http://mimo.gn.apc.org/mlx/

            sourceforge state
          - fixed bug of not parsed spots in new (copied) site module
          - e-mail is now mandatory for AA user
09/20/04 - Fixed buggy hierarchical constant editor (honzam)
09/07/04 - The value of Display counter could be set be CSV importer of itemform
(honzam) - bugfix - html flag for CSV import now works
09/06/04 - List of "related" items in inputform could be now filtered for most
(honzam)   input types. You can specify:
             - Conditions in conds[] array
             - Ordering of items in sort[] array
             - Bins from which you want to display items
             - Field to be shown (as option).
           This works for: Selectbox, Multiple selectbox, Multiple checkboxes,
           Two boxes, Radio buttons, and Text field with presets input types
           (sponsored by Philip King, thanks)
         - new "Form parts" feature - you can split the inputform to two or more
           subforms, where you can switch from one to another by clicking
           on the tab header. see {formbreak} alias in bottom HTML code
           for field. (sponsored by GreenNet, thanks)
         - List of "related" items in inputform could be now filtered for most
           input types. You can specify:
             - Conditions in conds[] array
             - Ordering of items in sort[] array
             - Bins from which you want to display items
             - Field to be shown (as option).
           This works for: Selectbox, Multiple selectbox, Multiple checkboxes,
           Two boxes, Radio buttons, and Text field with presets input types
         - charset conversion now works in case both charsets are the same,
           as well
09/03/04 - new French language support (submitted by Marek Tichy)
(honzam) - dview parameter (discussion design switcher) for slice.php3 now
           accepts "0":    dview=0 - no discussion printed
         - new slice.php3 all_scr=1 url parameter - scroller show also "All"
           option to show all items on one page.' slice.php3
         - added short_id and id field definitions - it allows searchbar in
           Item Manager to create filter also on Short id field
         - date format fix for cross server exchange - fixes wrong user data
           format
         - added "Show" button which displays output of the view in view admin
         - dates in discussion admin contains also year, now
         - fixed bug in File upload Input type - it didn't show "Browse" button,
           if "Accept" input parameter wasn't specified. Now it uses default */*
         - "Field to show" could be specified in Multiple Selectbox input type
           for slices
         - new _#PAGEINDX alias - index of item within a page (it begins from 0
           on each page listed by pagescroller) as opposite to _#ITEMINDX which
           contains index of item within whole listing
         - better paragraph detection in f_a alias function
         - new url_base parameter for Link module l_p alias function
         - new AA_USE_NON_PERSISTENT_CONNECT configuration option - use MySQL
           persistent connections or not?
         - bugfix - moving spots up and down in site module admin now work
           correctly also for last spot in the sequence
05/27/04 - new /misc/charset/convert.php3 script, which allows you to encode
(honzam)   a text to another character encoding. It is usable outside of AA.
           The ussage on shtml page:
           <!--#include
             virtual="/apc-aa/misc/charset/convert.php3?from=iso-8859-1&
             to=utf-8&source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apc.org%2Fpage.htm" -->
         - bulk email sending and alerts sending now should not end after
           timelimit. Now we have 2 minutes for each 20 e-mails.
         - feeding mapping for external feeds could now contain expressions
           (if "--value--" is selected) - just like in local feeding. So, you
           can do write {switch()} expression for status code, ...
         - if you "clear" searchbar in manager, then wrong values was filled
           in the order bar. Now it is fixed.
         - fixed link tag for APC AA RSS export (in order it could be used
           for RSS1.0 readers)
         - fixed bug on group permission page - it works again
         - fixed l_p alias for generating path links in the links module
         - deadlock error of MySQL database is not reported, if we delete
           records from pagecache table, now
         - fixed expansion of aliases, when contain colon character
05/17/04 - anonymous form wizard works again
(honzam) - added AA version info on title atribute of ActionApps logo
           in admin interface
         - added possibility to preview the view from admin interface
         - fixed "category top" and "category bottom" HTML for category grouped
           views and slices - you can use aliases in both this fields and it
           behaves as you could expect, now
         - [952262] fixed translation of "No item found" (and other) messages
           in views
05/15/04 - fixed problem with multivalue fields, when one of the value is empty
(honzam)   (it displayed number). Now we introduced FLAG_TEXT_STORED, which
           helps to determine text/numer stored values
         - fixed javascript error on several admin pages - it tried to display
           HTMLArea link, but the js file was not included
05/13/04 - fixed Cross Server Feeding - filters did not work properly (honzam)
05/11/04 - improved Cross Server Feeding
(honzam)    - added APC RSS and RSS test pages with debug options (see AA menu),
            - better handled categories (possibility to import any category
              (= all items) without change), you can also specify to feed items
              TO THE SAME category (just like for inner feeding),
            - better handled languages - all feeds now encoded and decoded
              to/from utf-8
         - improved all types of selectboxes and radio selections - if the
           content of variable (in the database) is a bit broken so the value is
           not listed in the array, which specifies the selectbox, then now
           the value is also listed in selectbox and is displayed in red
           (by CSS). This behavior make us sure, that we do not loose the value
           if we commit the form with such selectbox. It also gives information
           to user, that something is not right in the database.
           Also the bug for multiple selections was fixed (when empty value was
           selected, the number was written to the database. Now empty values
           aren't written to the DB for text_stored fields in content table
         - CSV import improvements
             - better default field mapping (tries to guess corresponding fields
               by field name),
             - possibility to create item id from any of the fields
               (from string/packed id/unpacked id)
             - better cache handling (invalidated after whole import
         - new parameters for i_s (image size) alias function
             - html    - (default) - returns image size as HTML atributes
                         (height='xxx' width='yyy')
             - width   - returns width of image in pixes
             - height  - returns height of image in pixels
             - imgtype - returns flag indicating the type of the image: 1 = GIF,
                         2 = JPG, 3 = PNG, 4 = SWF, 5 = PSD, 6 = BMP, 7 = TIFF
                         (intel byte order), 8 = TIFF (motorola byte order),
                         9 = JPC, 10 = JP2, 11 = JPX, 12 = JB2, 13 = SWC,
                         14 = IFF, 15 = WBMP, 16 = XBM
             - mime    - returns mimetype of the image (like 'image/gif',
                         'application/x-shockwave-flash', ...)
         - added possibility to display static columns in tabledit (used in
           admin/rsstest.php3 and admin/aarsstest.php3 pages
         - fixed broken admin interface for feeding (Update button didn't work)
         - fixed bug in alerts sending
         - fixed problem with displaying related items
04/30/04 - new "Group Update" possibility, which is used for filling one field
(honzam)   of all (or selected) items in the slice with specified content.
           Items could be selected manualy from Item Manager or by "Stored
           Search" feature (just like in "Bulk e-mail" feature. New content
           could be constant or could be combination of current items field.
           Any AA construct and aliases could be used for there.
         - Cross server feeding improved
            * slice character encoding is now handled properly - it uses
              conversion to utf-8 based on the encoding set for the slice
            * improved category handling - now we get all items and filtering
              is done on client side. New approach allows to download also items
              with not known category
         - slice imported by "slice import" is now imported also with all VIEWs
         - new f_t alias function parameter asis {alias:<field_id>::asis} which
           prints the field exactly as is in the database (regardless of
           HTML/Plain text settings). It is well used in conjunction with new
           "Group update" feature, where we often need the field as is.
         - added "Exported to" information to feedin setting page in order you
           know, where the slice is currently exported
         - the code is prepared for new - cookie based debuging (for programmers
           and superadministrators
         - "Bulk e-mail wizard" is converted to new FrmItemGroupSelect widget
           (used also for new "Group update" feature)
         - added default manager.class design (used for user listing as well
           as for related item selection listing
         - item class uses standard ItemContent class internaly for storing
           item data"
04/29/04 - special field "all_fields" and "all_fields_numeric" which you can use
(honzam)   with slice conditions (search form, ...)
              conds[0][all_fields]="hi"
           will find ANY text field containing "hi"
           You can use this syntax for simplified search conditions as well as
           for extended condition syntax. It is also possible to use
           "united field conditions" like
              conds[0][headline........,abstract........]='Hi'
           as equivalent to
              conds[0][headline........]=1&conds[0][abstract........]=1&
              conds[0][value]='Hi',conds[0][operator]=LIKE
           Number of united field conds is unlimited and you can use it
           in simplified condition syntax as well as in extended one
         - new aliases
             {cookie:<name>}
           which prints content of the cookie of the <name> and
             {item:<item_id_long_or_short>:<field_id_or_alias>}
           which returns <field_id> or _#ALIAS___ substitution for item
           of <short_id> or <long_id> - just like:
             {item:8ebc541d3703e64042cc198e6d0b026c:short_id........}
           or

         - designs and setting in Links module could be set also
           by administrator - not only by superadmins
         - default operation in searchbar is "contain", not "begins with"
         - time is incremented in steps also in admin interface, so the state
           of item in admin interface is the same as on the web
         - expired items not shown by default in related item selection window

(honzam) - used HTMLAREA 3 (http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea)
           instead of old RichText Editor
         - new manager class used for 'Item manager' and 'Related items
           selection window'. New manager allows much better searching (as many
           conditions as you want also with constant selection) and new
           possibility to save your query for future use
         - new profile class for better handling user's profiles
         - new Event class allowing us set event handlers for various events

           (through view)
         - bulk e-mail sending (to users from Reader slice)
         - 'related items selection window' now allows to define default filters
           of items (hidden filters as well as the preset ones). Now you can
           restrict from which items you want allow users to select related
           items
         - users from Reader slice could became Authors/Editors/Administrators
           of any slice (just like any other users) - now works for perm_LDAP
           only, but we can extend it to perm_sql as well
         - improved design of forms in admin interface (buttons on top, ...)
         - improved Node setting for intrer exchange (check some errors)
         - item class optimalization (simplifier constructor)
         - improved design of 'Manual feeding' (export)

           profile
         - added link to user names which links to user's setting
         - f_t alias function now supports output modification:
           csv / safe / javascript / urlencode / striptags
           (ussage: {alias:<field_id........>:f_t:the text - possibly with
           {some aliases}:urlencode(or another modifier)})
         - improved log function - added "selector" for easier searching in logs
         - new hint and show (what) feature in manager class
         - menu utils now supports javascript calling

           field for your slices

01/17/04 - speed optimalization for MySQL 4.0.x
(honzam) - used "=" operator instead of "IN ()", where possible
            - defined QUERY_DATE_STEP constants containing number of seconds
              after which is index listing regenerated (this means that
              SQL query for the same page is the same during the QUERY_DATE_STEP
              time - it helps MySQL to cache results
              (see constants.php3 - default is 1000))
         - added "o" paremeter to slice.php3 - the behavior is exactly the same
           as "x" parameter, but the "hit" is not counted for this item

           csv, urlencode, safe, javascript (see parameter wizard for more info)

         - table of items in Item Manager have bigger cellpadding

(honzam)   {@category.......1},
           {@category.......1(const_name,const_value,_#MY_ALIAS):,:_#1 _#2 _#3}
           As you see, you can also use aliases here. The Ussage is following:
               {@relation........(_#GET_HEAD): ,:_#1}
           where _#GET_HEAD is alias defined somewhere in current slice using
           f_t (for example):
               {item:{loop............}:headline}
           This displays all the related headlines delimeted by comma (since
           special field {loop............} contain one value from
           relation........ field
         - new {user:role} alias - returns
           author/editor/administrator/super/undefined

           about folder of found link
09/29/03 - related items now are displayed in user defined order (user can
(honzam)   easily move related items up and down by arrows - it must be allowed
           in "Field-setting -> Intut type"
         - feeding improvements:
           1) Through VALUE (in 'Mapping' page) you can specify not only new
              value, but you can write there also any AA expression, which is
              unaliased - example:
              <a href="{source_href.....}">{source..........}</a>
           2) You can specify, which items should be fed and which not. It is
              done by 1) (probably {switch()..} statement) for status_code.....
              field (1=Active, 2=Holding, 3=Trash, 4=Do not fed)
         - discussions under item can be posted to a mail (probably
           mailinglist). It is not new, but now you can use e-mail template for
           it (just like in Alerts) and use any discussion alias
           (like _#SUBJECT_) in e-mail's body or subject. Setting is the same
           as with view, but the template number is prefixed by "t" letter
           (like: t21:our-l@list.org.cz).
           Older approach (through discussion view) is deprecated.
         - cache content identifier for site module is extended to whole $apc
           variable (not only state), so you can use browser identification
           in $apc, now
         - hitCount is not updated so offten (for better database perfomance)
??/??/?? - notuploaded - fixed bug in importing slices when used hex coding
(mitra)
09/25/03 - Changes to summarize and related changes to se_inputform
09/23/03 - added possibility to get constant name (and other informations) from
(honzam)   constants value in unaliasing. The syntax is
           {const_name:category.......1} - prints constants name from current
           value in "category.......1" field. Possible informations are:
           const_name, const_value, const_short_id, const_description,
           const_pri, const_group, const_class, const_id
           (see constants table or constants view)
         - added possibility to specify more fields in 'd' parameter of

         - added new "sort" param to view.php3 (set[246]=sort-headline.......1)
         - "display count" of randomly displayed items (probably
