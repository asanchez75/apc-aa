           in "Field-setting -> Intut type"
         - feeding improvements:
           1) Through VALUE (in 'Mapping' page) you can specify not only new
              value, but you can write there also any AA expression, which is
              unaliased - example:
              <a href="{source_href.....}">{source..........}</a>
           2) You can specify, which items should be fed and which not. It is
              done by 1) (probably {switch()..} statement) for status_code.....
              field (1=Active, 2=Holding, 3=Trash, 4=Do not fed)
         - discussions under item can be posted to a mail (probably
           mailinglist). It is not new, but now you can use e-mail template for
           it (just like in Alerts) and use any discussion alias
           (like _#SUBJECT_) in e-mail's body or subject. Setting is the same
           as with view, but the template number is prefixed by "t" letter
           (like: t21:our-l@list.org.cz).
           Older approach (through discussion view) is deprecated.
         - cache content identifier for site module is extended to whole $apc
           variable (not only state), so you can use browser identification
           in $apc, now

           value in "category.......1" field. Possible informations are:
           const_name, const_value, const_short_id, const_description,
           const_pri, const_group, const_class, const_id
           (see constants table or constants view)
