    AA new language file
    
    This file should have 777 permissions to allow PHP as well as AA developers to access it.
    PHP automatically adds new language strings, see include/mgettext.php3.
    
    DON'T CHANGE THE IDS! Each language string has the form
    $mgettext_strings
    [ID] = array (
        "en"=>"blabla",
        ...);
    If you change the ID, all translations for it are lost. IDs are used in the source programs.
    If you change "blabla", it's all right.
    
    You don't have to add language strings if the ID suits you well 
    (that is, if the English wording is the same as in your language).
